avenue to bring their love one home as President there be no high priority for I than the safety of Americans hold hostagethe terrorist group Hamas unleash pure unadulterated evil in the world but sadly the jewish people know perhaps well than anyone that there be no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on othersIn Israel I see a people who be strong determined resilient and also angry in shock and in deep deep painI also speak with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterate that the United States remain committed to the palestinian people right to dignity and to selfdetermination the action of Hamas terrorist do not take that right awaylike so many other I be heartbroken by the tragic loss of palestinian life include the explosion at a hospital in Gazawhich be not do by the IsraelisWe mourn every innocent life lose we can not ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunityyou know

a sovereign state from the map Russia have shamelessly violate the core tenet of the United Nations Charterno more important than the clear prohibition against country take the territory of their neighbor by force again just today President Putin have make overt nuclear threat against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibility of the nonproliferation regime now Russia be

people whoever you be wherever you live whatever you believe that should notthat should make your blood run coldthat why 141 nation in the General Assembly come together to unequivocally condemn Russias war against Ukraine the United States have marshal massive level of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukrainemore than 25 billion to date our ally and partner around the world have step up as well and today more than 40 country represent in here have contribute billion of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself the United States

nation include our competitor to solve global problem like climate change climate diplomacy be not a favor to the United States or any other nation and walk away hurt the entire worldLet I be direct about the competition between the United States and China as we manage shift geopolitical trend the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader we do not seek conflict we do not seek a Cold War we do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner but the United States will be unabashe in promote our vision of a free open secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer community of nation investment that be design not to foster dependency but to alleviate burden and help nation become selfsufficient partnership not to create political obligation but because we know our own successeach of our success be increase when other nation succeed as wellWhen individual have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talent everyone benefit critical to that be live up to the high goal of this institution increase peace and security for everyone everywhere the United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continue terrorist threat to our world and we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflict we seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits we remain committed to our one China policy which have help prevent conflict for four decade and we continue to oppose unilateral change in the status quo by either side we support an african Unionled peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people in Venezuela where year of the political oppression have drive more than 6 million people from that country we urge a venezuelanled dialogue and a return to free and fair electionsWe continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it face politicalfuele gang violence and an enormous human crisisAnd we call on the world to do the same we have more to do well continue to back the UNmediated truce in Yemen which have deliver precious month of peace to people that have suffer year of warand we will continue to advocate for last negotiate peace between the jewish and democratic state of Israel and the palestinian people the United States be commit to Israels security full stop and a negotiate twostate solution remain in our view the good way to ensure Israels security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state whichto which they be entitledboth side to fully respect the equal right of their citizen both people enjoy equal measure of freedom and dignitylet I also urge every nation to recommit to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation regime through diplomacy no matter what else be happen in the world the United States be ready to pursue critical arm control measure a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight the five permanent member of the Security Council just reaffirm that commitment in January but today be see disturbing trend Russia shun the NonProliferation ideal embrace by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference and again today as I say they re make irresponsible nuclear threat to use nuclear weapon China be conduct an unprecedented concern nuclear buildup without any transparency despite our effort to begin serious and sustained diplomacy the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea continue to blatantly violate UN sanctionsand while the United States be prepare for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran step up to its obligation the United States be clear we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weaponi continue to believe that diplomacy be the good way to achieve this outcome the nonproliferation regime be one of the great success of this institution we can not let the world now slide backwards nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rightsPerhaps singular among this bodys achievement stand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which be the standard by which our forebear challenge we to measure ourselvesthey make clear in 1948 human right be the basis for all that we seek to achieve and yet today in 2022 fundamental freedom be at risk in every part of our world from the violation ofin Xinjiang detail in recent report by the Office of UNUSreports detail by the US UN High Commissioner to the horrible abuse against prodemocracy activist and ethnic minority by the military regime in Burma to the increase repression of woman and girl by the Taliban in AfghanistanAnd today we stand with the brave citizen and the brave woman of Iran who right now be demonstrate to secure their basic rightsbut here what I know the future will be win by those country that unleash the full potential of their population where woman and girl can exercise equal right include basic reproductive right and contribute fully to build a strong economy and more resilient society where religious and ethnic minority can live their life without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their community where the LGBTQ community individual live and love freely without be target with violence where citizen can question and criticize their leader without fear of reprisalThe United States will always promote human right and the value enshrine in the UN Charter in our own country and around the worldlet I end with this this institution guide by the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights be at its core an act of dauntless hopelet I say that again its an act of dauntless hopethink about the vision of those first delegate who undertake a seemingly impossible task while the world be still smolderingthink about how divide the people of the world must have feel with the fresh grief of million dead the genocidal horror of the Holocaust exposedthey have every right to believe only the bad of humanity instead they reach for what be good in all of we and they strove to build something well endure peace comity among nation equal right for every member of the human family cooperation for the advancement of all humankindMy fellow leader the challenge we face today be great indeed but our capacity be great our commitment must be great stillso let stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nation of the world be unite still that we stand for the value of the UN Charter that we still believe by work together we can bend the arc of history toward a free and more just world for all our child although none of we have fully

5 	 2022-09-01 	 the PRESIDENT my fellow Americans please if you have a seat take it I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America Independence Hall in Philadelphia Pennsylvania this be where America make its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two century ago with an idea unique among nation that in America be all create equal this be where the United States Constitution be write and debate this be where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of selfgovernment the world have ever know with three simple word we the People we the People these two document and the idea they embodyequality and democracyare the rock upon which this nation be build they be how we become the great nation on Earth they be why for more than two century America have be a beacon to the world but as I stand here tonight equality and democracy be under assault we do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise so tonight I have come this place where it all begin to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threat we face about the power we have in our own hand to meet these threat and about the incredible future that lie in front of we if only we choose it we must never forget we the people be the true heir of the american experiment that begin more than two century ago we the people have burn inside each of we the flame of liberty that be light here at Independence Halla flame that light our way through abolition the Civil War Suffrage the Great Depression world war Civil Rights that sacred flame still burn now in our time as we build an America that be more prosperous free and just that be the work of my presidency a mission I believe in with my whole soul but first we must be honest with each other and with ourselves too much of what s happen in our country today be not normal Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threaten the very foundation of our republic now I want to be very clearvery clear up front not every Republican not even the majority of Republicans be MAGA Republicans not every republican embrace their extreme ideology I know because I ve be able to work with these mainstream Republicans but there be no question that the Republican Party today be dominate drive and intimidate by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans and that be a threat to this country these be hard thing but I m an American Presidentnot the President of red America or blue America but of all America and I believe it be my dutymy duty to level with you to tell the truth no matter how difficult no matter how painful and here in my view be what be true MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution they do not believe in the rule of law they do not recognize the will of the people they refuse to accept the result of a free election and they re work right now as I speak in state after state to give power to decide election in America to partisan and crony empower election denier to undermine democracy itself MAGA force be determined to take this country backwardsbackward to an America where there be no right to choose no right to privacy no right to contraception no right to marry who you love they promote authoritarian leader and they fan the flame of political violence that be a threat to our personal right to the pursuit of justice to the rule of law to the very soul of this country they look at the mob that storm the United States Capitol on January 6thbrutally attack law enforcementnot as insurrectionist who place a dagger to the throat of our democracy but they look at they as patriot and they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 election they try everything last time to nullify the vote of 81 million people this time they re determined to succeed in thwart the will of the people that s why respected conservative like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig have call Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans quote a clear and present danger to our democracy but while the threat to american democracy be real I want to say as clearly as we can we be not powerless in the face of these threat we be not bystander in this ongoing attack on democracy there be far more americansfar more Americans from everyfrom every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it and folk it be within our power its in our handsyour and mineto stop the assault on american democracy I believe America be at an inflection pointone of those moment that determine the shape of everything that s to come after and now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards to build the future or obsess about the past to be a nation of hope and unity and optimism or a nation of fear division and of darkness MAGA Republicans have make their choice they embrace anger they thrive on chaos they live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lie but togethertogether we can choose a different path we can choose a well path Forward to the future a future of possibility a future to build and dream and hope and be on that path move ahead I know this nation I know you the american people I know your courage I know your heart and I know our history this be a nation that honor our Constitution we do not reject it this be a nation that believe in the rule of law we do not repudiate it this be a nation that respect free and fair election we honor the will of the people we do not deny it and this be a nation that reject violence as a political tool we do not encourage violence we be still an America that believe in honesty and decency and respect for other patriotism liberty justice for all hope possibility we be still at our core a democracy and yet history tell we that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence be fatal to democracy for a long time we ve tell ourselves that american democracy be guarantee but its not we have to defend it protect it stand up for iteach and every one of usthat why tonight I m ask our nation to come together unite behind the single purpose of defend our democracy regardless of your ideology be all call by duty and conscience to confront extremist who will put their own pursuit of power above all else Democrats independent mainstream Republicans we must be strong more determined and more committed to save american democracy than MAGA Republicans be toto destroy american democracy we the people will not let anyone or anything tear we apart today there be danger around we we can not allow to prevail we hearyouve hear itmore and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country its not it can never be an acceptable tool so I want to say this plain and simple there be no place for political violence in America Period None ever we see law enforcement brutally attack on January the 6th we ve see election official poll workersmany of they volunteer of both partiessubjecte to intimidation and death threat Andcan you believe itFBI agent just do their job as direct face threat to their own life from their own fellow citizen on top of that there be public figurestoday yesterday and the day beforepredicte and all but call for mass violence and rioting in the streetsthis be inflammatory its dangerous its against the rule of law and we the people must say this be not who we be Ladies and gentleman we can not be proinsurrectionist and proAmerican they re incompatible we can not allow violence to be normalize in this country its wrong we each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster now we can not let the integrity of our election be undermine for that be a path to chaos Look I know politic can be fierce and mean and nasty in America I get it I believe in the giveandtake of politic in disagreement and debate and dissent be a big complicated country but democracy endure only if we the people respect the guardrail of the republic only if we the people accept the result of free and fair election only if we the people see politic not as total war but mediation of our difference Democracy can not survive when one side believe there be only two outcome to an election either they win or they be cheat and that s where MAGA Republicans be today they do not understand what every patriotic american know you can not love your country only when you win its fundamental american democracy only work only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institution that be set up in this chamber behind I only if we respect our legitimate political difference I will not stand by and watchI will notthe will of the american people be overturn by

he will never weaken the resolve of the free world we meet tonight in an America that have live through two of the hard year this nation have ever face the pandemic have be punish and so many family be live paycheck to paycheck struggle to keep up with the rise cost of food gas housing and so much more I understand I remember when my dad have to leave our home in Scranton Pennsylvania to find work I grow up in a family where if the price of food go up you feel it that s why one of the first thing I do as President be fight to pass the American Rescue Plan because people be hurt we need to act and we do few piece of legislation have do more in a critical moment in our history to lift we out of crisis it fuel our effort to vaccinate the nation and combat covid19 it deliver immediate economic relief for ten of million of Americans help put food on their table keep a roof over their head and cut the cost of health insurance and as my dad use to say it give people a little breathing room and unlike the 2trillion tax cut pass in the previous administration that benefit the top 1 percent of Americans the American Rescue Plan help work peopleand leave no one behind and it work it create job lot of job in factour economy create over 65 million new job just last year more job create in one year than ever before in the history of America our economy grow at a rate of 57 percent last year the strong growth in nearly 40 year the first step in bring fundamental change to an economy that have not work for the work people of this nation for too long for the past 40 year we be tell that if we give tax break to those at the very top the benefit would trickle down to everyone else but that trickledown theory lead to weak economic growth low wage big deficit and the wide gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century Vice President Harris and I run for office with a new economic vision for America Invest in America Educate Americans grow the workforce build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down because we know that when the middle class grow the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well America use to have the good road bridge and airport on Earth now our infrastructure be rank 13th in the world we will not be able to compete for the job of the 21st Century if we do not fix that that s why it be so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Lawthe most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history this be a bipartisan effort and I want to thank the member of both party who work to make it happen be do talk about infrastructure week be go to have an infrastructure decade it be go to transform America and put we on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the worldparticularly with China as I ve tell Xi Jinping it be never a good bet to bet against the american people well create good job for million of Americans modernize road airport port and waterway all across America and well do it all to withstand the devastate effect of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice well build a national network of 500000

disrepair when we use taxpayer dollar to rebuild Americawe be go to buy american buy american product to support american job the federal government spend about 600 billion a year to keep the country safe and secure there s be a law on the book for almost a century to make sure taxpayer dollar support american job and business every Administration say they ll do it but we be actually do it we will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrail be make in America but to compete for the good job of the future we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitor that s why it be so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sit in Congress that will make record investment in emerge technology and american manufacturing let I give you one example of why its so important to pass it if you travel 20 mile east of Columbus Ohio you ll find 1000 empty acre of land it will not look like much but if you stop and look closely you ll see a Field of dream the ground on which Americas future will be build this be where Intel the american company that helped build Silicon Valley be go to build its 20 billion semiconductor mega site up to eight stateoftheart factory in one place 10000 new goodpaying job some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chip the size of a fingertip

4000 job in Michigan all tell we create 369000 new manufacturing job in America just last year power by people I ve meet like JoJo Burgess from generation of union steelworker from Pittsburgh who s here with we tonight as Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown say its time to bury the label Rust Belt its time but with all the bright spot in our economy record job growth and high wage too many family be struggle to keep up with the bill Inflation be rob they of the gain they might otherwise feel I get it that s why my top priority be get price under control look our economy roar back fast than most predict but the pandemic mean that business have a hard time hire enough worker to keep up production in their factory the pandemic also disrupt global supply chain when factory close it take long to make good and get they from the warehouse to the store and price go up look at car last year there be not enough semiconductor to make all the car that people want to buy and guess what price of automobile go up Sowe have a choice one way to fight inflation be to drive down wage and make Americans poor I have a well plan to fight inflation Lower your cost not your wage make more car and semiconductor in America More infrastructure and innovation in America More good move fast and cheap in America More job where you can earn a good living in America and instead of rely on foreign supply chain let make it in America Economists call it increase the productive capacity of our economy I call it build a well America my plan to fight inflation will lower your cost and lower the deficit Seventeen Nobel laureate in economic say my plan will ease longterm inflationary pressure top business leader and most Americans support my plan and here the plan Firstcut the cost of prescription drug just look at insulin one in ten Americans have diabete in Virginia I meet a 13yearold boy name Joshua Davis He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes which mean they need insulin every day Insulin cost about 10 a vial to make but drug company charge family like Joshua and his dad up to 30 time more I speak with Joshuas mom Imagine what its like to look at your child who need insulin and have no idea how you re go to pay for it what it do to your dignity your ability to look your child in the eye to be the parent you expect to be Joshua be here with we tonight yesterday be his birthday happy birthday buddy for Joshua and for the 200000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes let cap the cost of insulin at 35 a month so everyone can afford it drug company will still do very well and while be at it let Medicare negotiate low price for prescription drug like the VA already do look the American Rescue Plan be help million of family on Affordable Care Act plan save 2400 a year on their health care premium let close the coverage gap and make those saving permanent secondcut energy cost for family an average of 500 a year by combat climate change let provide investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and business to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit double Americas clean energy production in solar wind and so much more low the price of electric vehicle save you another 80 a month because you ll never have to pay at the gas pump again thirdcut the cost of child care many family pay up to 14000 a year for child care per child Middleclass and work family should not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for care of young child my plan will cut the cost in half for most family and help parent include million of woman who leave the workforce during the pandemic because they could not afford child care to be able to get back to work my plan do not stop there it also include home and longterm care More affordable housing and PreK for every 3 and 4yearold all of these will lower cost and under my plan nobody earn less than 400000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxis nobody the one thing all Americans agree on be that the tax system be not fair we have to fix it I m not look to punish anyone but let make sure corporation and the wealthy Americans start pay their fair share just last year 55 Fortune 500 corporation earn 40 billion in profit and pay zero dollar in federal income tax that s simply not fair that s why I ve propose a 15percent minimum tax rate for corporation we get more than 130 country to agree on a global minimum tax rate so company can not get out of pay their taxis at home by ship job and factory overseas that s why I ve propose closing loophole so the very wealthy do not pay a low tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter so that s my plan it will grow the economy and low cost for family so what be we wait for Lets get this do and while you re at it confirm my nominee to the Federal Reserve which play a critical role in fight inflation my plan will not only low cost to give family a fair shot it will lower the deficit the previous Administration not only balloon the deficit with tax cut for the very wealthy and corporation it undermine the watchdog whose job be to keep pandemic relief fund from be waste but in my administration the watchdog have be welcome back

cut off more than half of Russias hightech importsIt will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military it ll degrade their aerospace industry include their space program it will hurt their ability to build ship reduce their ability to compete economically and it will be a major hit to Putins longterm strategic ambition and be prepare to do more in addition to the

United States Capitol this be where the House of Representatives meet for 50 year in the decade lead up to the Civil War this ison this floor be where a young congressman of Illinois Abraham Lincoln sit at desk 191 above himabove we over that door lead into the Rotundais a sculpture depict Clio the muse of history in her hand an open book in which she record the event take place in this chamber belowclio stood watch over this hall one year ago today as she have for more than 200 year she record what take place the real history the real fact the real truth the fact and the truth that Vice President Harris just share and that you and I and the whole world see with our own eyesThe Bible tell we that we shall know the truth and the truth shall make we free we shall know the truthwell here be the Gods truth about January 6th 2021close your eye go back to that day what do you see rioter rampage wave for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolize the cause to destroy America to rip we aparteven during the Civil War that never ever happen but it happen here in 2021What else do you see a mob break window kicking in door breach the Capitol american flag on pole be use as weapon as spear Fire extinguisher be throw at the head of police officer a crowd that profess their love for law enforcement assault those police officer drag they spray they stomp on themover 140 police officer be injuredweve all hear the police officer who be there that day testify to what happen one officer call it quote a medmedieval battle and that he be more afraid that day than he be fight the war in IraqTheyve repeatedly ask since that day how dare anyoneanyonediminish belittle or deny the hell they be put throughWe see it with our own eye rioter menace these hall threaten the life of the Speaker of the House literally erect gallow to hang the Vice President of the United States of AmericaBut what do we not seeWe do not see a former president who have just rally the mob to attacksitte in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watch it all on television and do nothing for hour as police be assault life at risk and the nation capital under siegethis be not a group of tourist this be an armed insurrectionthey be not look to uphold the will of the people they be look to deny the will of the peoplethey be look to upholdthey be not look to uphold a free and fair election they be look to overturn onethey be not look to save the cause of America they be look to subvert the ConstitutionThis be not about be bogge down in the past this be about make sure the past be not buriedthat the only way forward that s what great nation do they do not bury the truth they face up to it sound like hyperbole but that s the truth they face up to itWe be a great nationMy fellow Americans in life there s truth and tragically there be lieslie conceive and spread for profit and powerWe must be absolutely clear about what be true and what be a lieand here be the truth the former president of the United States of America have create and spread a web of lie about the 2020 election he s do so because he value power over principle because he see his own interest as more important than his countrys interest and Americas interest and because his bruise ego matter more to he than our democracy or our constitutionhe can not accept he lose even though that s what 93 United States senator his own Attorney General his own Vice President governor and state official in every battleground state have all say he lostthat what 81 million of you do as you vote for a new way forwardHe have do what no president in American historythe history of this countryhas ever ever do he refuse to accept the result of an election and the will of the american peoplewhile some courageous man and woman in the Republican Party be stand against it try to uphold the principle of that party too many other be transform that party into something else they seem no long to want to be the partythe party of Lincoln Eisenhower Reagan the bushesbut whatever my other disagreement be with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man I will always seek to work together with they to find share solution where possible because if we have a share belief in democracy then anything be possibleanythingand so at this moment we must decide what kind of nation be we go to beare we go to be a nation that accept political violence as a normAre we go to be a nation where we allow partisan election official to overturn the legally express will of the peopleare we go to be a nation that live not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of liesWe can not allow ourselves to be that kind of nation the way forward be to recognize the truth and to live by itthe big lie be tell by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath be that the insurrection in this country actually take place on Election DayNovember 3rd 2020think about that be that what you think be that what you think when you vote that day take part in an insurrection be that what you think you be do or do you think you be carry out your high duty as a citizen and votingthe former president and his supporter be try to rewrite history they want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that take place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the peopleCan you think of a more twisted way to look at this countryto look at America I cannothere the truth the election of 2020 be the great demonstration of democracy in the history of this countrymore of you vote in that election than have ever vote in all of american history over 150 million Americans go to the poll and vote that day in a pandemicsome at greagreat risk to their life they should be applaud not attackedright now in state after state new law be be writtennot to protect the vote but to deny it not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it not to strengthen or protect our democracy but because the former president lostInstead of look at the election result from 2020 and say they need new idea or well idea to win more vote the former president and his supporter have decide the only way for they to win be to suppress your vote and subvert our election its wrong its undemocratic and frankly its unamericanthe second big lie be tell by the former President and his supporter be that the result of the election of 2020 can not be trustedthe truth be that no electionno election in american history have be more closely scrutinize or more carefully countedevery legal challenge question the result in every court in this country that could have be make be make and be rejectedoften reject by republicanappointe judge include judge appoint by the former president himself from state court to the United States Supreme CourtRecounts be undertake in state after state GeorgiaGeorgia count its result three time with one recount by handPhony partisan audits be undertake long after the election in several state None change the result and in some of they the irony be the margin of victory actually grow slightlySo let speak plainly about what happen in 2020 even before the first ballot be cast the former president be preemptively sow doubt about the election result he build his lie over month it be not base on any fact he be just look for an excusea pretextto cover for the truthhes not just a former president he s a defeat former presidentdefeate by a margin of over 7 million of your vote in a full and free and fair electionthere be simply zero proof the election result be inaccurate in fact in every venue where evidence have to be produce and an oath to tell the truth have to be take the former president fail to make his casejust think about this the former president and his supporter have never be able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election result that take place on November 3rdthe election for governor United States Senate the House of Representativeselections in which they close the gap in the HouseThey challenge none of that the Presidents name be first then we go down the linegovernor senator House of Representatives somehow those result be accurate on the same ballot but the presidential race be flawedand on the same ballot the same day cast by the same votersthe only difference the former President do not lose those race he just lose the one that be his ownfinally the third big lie be tell by a former President and his supporter be that the mob who seek to impose their will through violence be the nation true patriotsIs that what you think when you look at the mob ransack the Capitol destroy property literally defecate in the hallway rifle through desk of senator and representative hunt down member of congress Patriots not in my viewTo I the true patriot be the more than 150 million Americans who peacefully express their vote at the ballot box the election worker who protect the integrity of the vote and the hero who defend this CapitolYou can not love your country only when you winyou can not obey the law only when its convenientyou can not be patriotic when you embrace and enable liesthose who storm this Capitol and those who instigate and incite and those who call on they to do so hold a dagger at the throat of Americaat American democracythey do not come here out of patriotism or principle they come here in ragenot in service of America but rather in service of one manThose who incite the mobthe real plotterswho be desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the votersBut their plot be foil CongressmenDemocrats and Republicansstayed Senators representative staffthey finish their work the Constitution demand they honor their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemy foreign and domesticlook folk now its up to all of usto we the Peopleto stand for the rule of law to preserve the flame of democracy to keep the promise of America alivethat promise be at risk target by the force that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy fear over hope personal gain over public goodmake no mistake about it be live at an inflection point in historyBoth at home and abroad be engage anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy between the aspiration of the many and the greed of the few between the people right of selfdetermination and selfthe selfseeke autocrat from China to Russia and beyond they re bet that democracys day be number they ve actually tell I democracy be too slow too bogge down by division to succeed in today rapidly change complicated worldAnd they re bettingtheyre bet America will become more like they and less like we they re bet that America be a place for the autocrat the dictator the strongmanI do not believe that that be not who we be that be not who we have ever be and that be not who we should ever

go to be sign a law that be truly consequential because we make our democracy deliver for the american people we compromise we reach a consensus that s necessary and now our focus move to implement an infrastructure law that s go to with speed and with discipline I have a lot of experience in do that when I be Vice President I be give responsibility for oversee and implement the Recovery Act a nearly 900 billion emergency package I m proud to say that when we finish implement that Recovery Act it be determined that there have be less than two tenth of 1 percent waste fraud or abuse and I be

12 	 2021-09-09 	 the PRESIDENT Good evening my fellow Americans I want to talk to you about where we be in the battle against covid19 the progress we ve make and the work we have leave to doand it start with understand this even as the Delta variant 19 sic hascovid19ha been hit this country hard we have the tool to combat the virus if we can come together as a country and use those toolsIf we raise our vaccination rate protect ourselves and other with mask and expand testing and identify people who be infect we can and we will turn the tide on COVID19It will take a lot of hard work and its go to take some time many of we be frustrate with the nearly 80 million Americans who be still not vaccinate even though the vaccine be safe effective and freeyou might be confuse about what be true and what be false about covid19 so before I outline the new step to fight covid19 that I m go to be announce tonight let I give you some clear information about where we standfirst we have conswe have make considerable progressin battle covid19 when I become President about 2 million Americans be fully vaccinate today over 175 million Americans have that protection before I take office we have not order enough vaccine for every American just week in office we do the week before I take office on January 20th of this year over 25000 Americans die that week from covid19 last week that grim weekly toll be down 70 percentand in the three month before I take office our economy be falter create just 50000 job a month be now average 700000 new job a month in the past three monthsthis progress be real but while America be in much well shape than it be seven month ago when I take office I need to tell you a second factwere in a tough stretch and it could last for a while the highly contagious Delta variant that I begin to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it do in other country before usWhile the vaccine provide strong protection for the vaccinated we read about we hear about and we see the story of hospitalize people people on their death bed among the unvaccinated over these past few week this be a pandemic of the unvaccinated and its cause by the fact that despite America have an unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five month free vaccine have be available in 80000 different location we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have fail to get the shot and to make matter worse there be elect official actively work to undermine the fight against covid19 instead of encourage people to get vaccinate and mask up they re order mobile morgue for the unvaccinated die from COVID in their community this be totally unacceptablethird if you wonder how all this add up here the math the vast majority of Americans be do the right thing nearly three quarter of the eligible have get at least one shot but one quarter have not get any that s nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinate and in a country as large as our that s 25 percent minority that 25 percent can cause a lot of damageand they arethe unvaccinated overcrowd our hospital be overrun the emergency room and intensive care unit leave no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreitis pancreatitis or cancerAnd fourth I want to emphasize that the vaccine provide very strong protection from severe illness from covid19 I know there s a lot of confusion and misinformation but the world lead scientist confirm that if you be fully vaccinate your risk of severe illness from covid19 be very low in fact base on available datum from the summer only one of out of every 160000 fully vaccinate Americans be hospitalize for covid per dayThese be the fact so here where we stand the path ahead even with the Delta variant be not nearly as bad as last winter but what make it incredibly more frustrating be that we have the tool to combat covid19 and a distinct minority of Americans support by a distinct minority of elect officialsare keep we from turn the corner these pandemic politic as I refer to be make people sick cause unvaccinated people to die we can not allow these action to stand in the way of protect the large majority of Americans who have do their part and want to get back to life as normal as your President I m announce tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinate to combat those block public health my plan also increase testing protect our economy and will make our kid safe in school it consist of six broad area of action and many specific measure in each thatand each of those action that you can read more about at WhiteHousegov WhiteHousegovThe measuresthese be go to take time to have full impact but if we implement they I believe and the scientist indicate that in the month ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans decrease hospitalization and death and allow our child to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keep business openfirst we must increase vaccination among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirement of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinate many say they be wait for approval from the Food and Drug Administrationthe FDA well last month the FDA grant that approvalSo the time for wait be over this summer we make progress through the combination of vaccine requirement and incentive as well as the FDA approval four million more people get their first shot in August than they do in July but we need to do more this be not about freedom or personal choice its about protect yourself and those around youthe people you work with the people you care about the people you loveMy job as President be to protect all Americans so tonight I m announce that the Department of Labor be develop an emergency rule to require all employer with 100 or more employee that together employ over 80 million worker to ensure their workforce be fully vaccinate or show a negative test at least once a weeksome of the big company be already require this United Airlines Disney Tysons Food and even Fox NewsThe bottom line be go to protect vaccinated worker from unvaccinated coworker be go to reduce the spread of covid19 by increase the share of the workforce that be vaccinate in business all across AmericaMy plan will extend the vaccination requirement that I previously issue in the healthcare field already I ve announce well be require vaccination that all nursing home worker who treat patient on Medicare and Medicaid because I have that federal authoritytonight I m use that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospital home healthcare facility or other medical facilitiesa total of 17 million healthcare workersIf you re seek care at a health facility you should be able to know that the people treat you be vaccinate Simple Straightforward PeriodNext I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employee to be vaccinatedall and I ve sign another executive order that will require federal contractor to do the sameif you want to work with the federal government and do business with we get vaccinate if you want to do business with the federal government vaccinate your workforce and tonight I m remove one of the last remain obstacle that make it difficult for you to get vaccinatedthe Department of Labor will require employer with 100 or more worker to give those worker pay time off to get vaccinate no one should lose pay in order to get vaccinate or take a love one to get vaccinatedToday in total the vaccine requirement in my plan will affect about 100 million Americanstwo third of all worker and for other sector I issue this appeal to those of you run large entertainment venuesfrom sport arena to concert venue to movie theatersplease require folk to get vaccinate or show a negative test as a condition of entryand to the nations family physician pediatrician GPsgeneral practitionersyoure the most trust medical voice to your patient you may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about be vaccinate Tonight I m ask each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patient over the next two week and make a personal appeal to they to get the shot America need your personal involvement in this critical effortand my message to unvaccinated Americans be this what more be there to wait for what more do you need to see we ve make vaccination free safe and convenientthe vaccine have FDA approval over 200 million Americans have get at least one shot we ve be patient but our patience be wear thin and your refusal have cost all of we so please do the right thing but just do not take it from I listen to the voice of unvaccinated Americans who be lie in hospital bed take their final breath say if only I have get vaccinate if onlyits a tragedy please do not let it become yoursthe second piece of my plan be continue to protect the vaccinatedFor the vast majority of you who have get vaccinate I understand your anger at those who have not get vaccinate I understand the anxiety about get a breakthrough caseBut as the science make clear if you re fully vaccinate you re highly protect from severe illness even if you get covid19 in fact recent datum indicate there be only one confirm positive case per 5000 fully vaccinate Americans per dayyoure as safe as possible and be do everything we can to keep it that waykeep it that way keep you safethat where booster come inthe shot that give you even more protection than after your second shotnow I know there s be some confusion about booster so let I be clear last month our top government doctor announce an initial plan for booster shot for vaccinated Americans they believe that a booster be likely to provide the high level of protection yetof course the decision of which booster shot to give when to start they and who will give they will be leave completely to the scientist at the FDA and the Centers for Disease ControlBut while we wait we ve do our part we ve buy enough boostersenough booster shotsand the distribution system be ready to administer themAs soon as they be authorize those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in ten of thousand of site across thesite across the country for most Americans at your nearby drug store and for free the third piece of my plan be keepingand maybe the most importantis keep our child safe and our school open for any parent it do not matter how low the risk of any illness or accident be when it come to your child or grandchild trust I I know so let I speak to you directly let I speak to you directly to help ease some of your worriesIt come down to two separate category child age 12 and old who be eligible for a vaccine now and child age 11 and under who be not be yet eligiblethe safe thing for your child 12 and old be to get they vaccinated they get vaccinate for a lot of thing that s it get they vaccinateda with adult almost all the serious covid19 case be see among adolescent be in unvaccinated 12 to 17yearoldsan age group that lag behind in vaccination ratesSo parent please get your teenager vaccinatedwhat about child under the age of 12 who can not get vaccinate yet well the good way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 start at home every parent every teen sible every caregiver around they should be vaccinate child have four time high chance of getting hospitalize if they live in a state with low vaccination rate rather than the state with high vaccination rate now if you re a parent of a young child you re wonder when will it bewhen will it bethe vaccine available for they I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine use for child under 12 we can not take shortcut with that scientific work but I ve make it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it need to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible and our nation top doctor be commit to keep the public at large update on the process so parent can plannow to the school we know that if school follow the science and implement the safety measureslike testing mask adequate ventilation system that we provide the money for social distancing and vaccinationsthen child can be safe from covid19 in schoolstoday about 90 percent of school staff and teacher be vaccinate we should get that to 100 percent my administration have already acquire teacher at the school run by the Defense Departmentbecause I have the authority as President in the federal systemthe Defense Department and the Interior Departmentto get vaccinate that s authority I possess tonight I m announce that well require all of nearly 300000 educator in the federal pay program Head Start program must be vaccinate as well to protect your youngestour youngestmost precious Americans and give parent the comfortand tonight I m call on all governor to require vaccination for all teacher and staff some already have do so but we need more to step up vaccination requirement in school be nothing new they work they re overwhelmingly support by educator and their union and to all school official try to do the right thing by our child Ill always be on your side let I be blunt my plan also take on elect official and state that be undermine you and these lifesaving action right now local school official be try to keep child safe in a pandemic while their governor pick a fight with they and even threaten their salary or their job talk about bully in school if they ll not helpif these governor will not help we beat the pandemic Ill use my power as President to get they out of the way the Department of Education have already begin to take legal action against state undermine protection that local school official have order any teacher or school official whose pay be withhold for do the right thing we will have that pay restore by the federal government 100 percent I promise you I will have your back the fourth piece of my plan be increase testing and mask from the start America have fail to do enough covid19 testing in order to well detect and control the Delta variant I m take step tonight to make testing more available more affordable and more convenient Ill use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid test include those that you can use at home while that production be ramp up my administration have work with top retailer like Walmart Amazon and Krogers and tonight be announce that no later than next week each of these outlet will start to sell athome rapid test kit at cost for the next three month this be an immediate price reduction for athome test kit for up to 35 percent reductionwell also expandexpand free testing at 10000 pharmacy around the country and well commitwere commit 2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid test for distribution to community health center food bank school so that every American no matter their income can access free and convenient test this be important to everyone particularly for a parent or a childwith a child not old enough to be vaccinate you ll be able to test they at home and test those around themin addition to testing we know masking help stop the spread of covid19 that s why when I come into office I require mask for all federal building and on federal land on airline and other mode of transportation Todaytonight I m announce that the Transportation Safety Administrationthe tsawill double the fine on traveler that refuse to mask if you break the rule be prepared to pay and by the way show some respect the anger you see on television toward flight attendant and other do their job be wrong its ugly the fifth piece of my plan be protect our economic recovery

and make you pay I will defend our interest and our people with every measure at my commandover the past few weeksI know youremany of you be probably tired of hear I say itweve be make aware by our intelligence community that the ISISKan archenemy of the Taliban people who be free when both those prison be openedha be plan a complex set of attack on the United States personnel and othersthis be why from the outset I ve repeatedly say this mission be extraordinarily dangerous and why I have be so determined to limit the duration of this missionAnd as General McKenzie say this be why our mission be designedthis be the way it be design to operate operate under severe stress and attack we ve know that from the beginningAnd as I ve be in constant contact with our senior military leadersand I mean constant around the clockand our commander on the ground and throughout the day they make it clear that we can and we must complete this mission and we will and that s what I ve order they to dowe will not be deter by terrorist we will not let they stop our mission we will continue the evacuationive also order my commander to develop operational plan to strike ISISK asset leadership and facility we will respond with force and precision at our time at the place we choose and the moment of our choose here be what you need to know these ISIS terrorist will not win we will rescue the Americans who be there we will get out our afghan ally out and our mission will go on America will not be intimidate I have the utmost confidence in our brave service member who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save life and get Americans our partner our afghan ally out of AfghanistanEvery day when I talk to our commander I ask they what they needwhat more do they need if anything to get the job do as they will tell you I grant every request I reiterate to they again today on three occasion that they should take the maximum step necessary to protect our force on the ground in KabulAnd I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon and all the commander in the field there have be complete unanimity from every commander on the objective of this mission and the good way to achieve those objectivesthose who have serve through the age have draw inspiration from the Book of Isaiah when the Lord say whom shall I sendwho shall go for we and the american military have be answer for a long time here be I Lord send I here I be send meeach one of these woman and man of our armed force be the heir of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteer to go into harm way to risk everythingnot for glory not for profit but to defend what we love and the people we loveand I ask that you join I now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniformmilitary and civilian who have give the last full measure of devotiona moment of silence be takenthank you may God bless you all and may God protect those troop and all those standing watch for America we have so much to do its within our capacity to do it we just have to remain steadfast Steadfast we will complete our mission and we will continue after our troop have withdraw to find mean by which we define any American who wish to get out of Afghanistan we will find they and we will get they out Ladies and gentleman they give I a list here the first person I be instruct to call on be Kelly ODonnell of NBCQ Mr President you have say leave Afghanistan be in the national interest of the United States after today attack do you believe you will authorize additional force to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan and be youare you prepare to add additional force to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carry out the evacuation operationthe PRESIDENT I ve instruct the military whatever they needif they need additional forceI will grant it but the militaryfrom the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs the Joint Chiefs the commander in the fieldhave all contact I one way or another usually by letter say they subscribe to the mission as design to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that be allot that be the good way they believe to get as many Americans out as possible and other and with regard to find track down the ISIS leader who order this we have some reason to believe we know who they arenot certainand we will find way of our choosing without large military operation to get themq inside Afghanistan Mr presidentthe PRESIDENT wherever they aretrevor from reutersq thank you Mr President there have be some criticism even from people in your party about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport do you feel like there be a mistake make in that regardTHE PRESIDENT no I do not look I think General McKenzie handle this question very well the fact be that be in a situationwe inherit a situation particularly since as we all know that the afghan military collapse 11 day beforein 11 daysthat it be in the interest of as Mackenzie say in the interest of the Taliban that in fact ISISK do not metastasize beyond what it be number one and number two its in their interest that we be able to leave on time on target as a consequence of that the major thing we ve ask themmove back the perimeter give I more space between the wall stop vehicle from come through et cetera search people come throughit be not what you d call a tightly command regimented operation like the US isthe military isbut they re act in their interesttheir interestand so by and largeand I ve ask this same question to military on the ground whether or not its a useful exercise no one trust they be just count on their selfinterest to continue to generate their activity and its in their selfinter that we leave when we say and that we get as many people out as we canand like I say even in the midst of everything that happen today over 7000 people have get out over 5000 Americans overallso its not a matter of trust its a matter of mutual selfinter Andbut there be no evidence thus far that I ve be give as a consequence by any of our commander in the field that there have be collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carry out what happen today both in front of the hotel and what be expect to continue forbeyond todayAamer Associated PressQ thank you Mr President you have speak again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decision with that in mindand also what you ve say that the long we stay the more likelihood that there would be a major attackhow do you weigh stay even one more day consider what s happenedthe PRESIDENT because I think what America say matter what we say be go to do and the context in which we say be go to do it that we do itunless something exceptional changesThere be additional american citizen there be additional green card holder there be additional personnel of our ally there be additional SIV card holder there be additional Afghans that have help we and there be additional group of individual that have contact we from women group to NGOs and other who have expressly indicate they want to get out and have gather in certain circumstance in group on bus and other mean that still present the opportunity for the next several day between now and the 31st to be able to get they outand our militaryand I believe to the extent that we can do that know the threat know that we may very well have another attackthe military have conclude that s what we should do I think they re right I think they re correctand after that be go to be in a circumstance where there arewill be I believe numerous opportunity to continue to provide access for additional person to get out of Afghanistan either through mean that we provide andor be provide through cooperation with the Taliban they re not good guy the Taliban I m not suggest that at all but they have a keen interest as many of you have be report they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open they do not have the capacity to do it they very much be try to figure out whether or not they can maintain what be the portion of an economy that have become not robust but fundamentally different than it have beenand so there s a lot of reason why they have reach out not just to we but to other as to why it would be continue in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out we can locate themnow there s not many leave that we can assess that arewant to come out there s some Americans we ve identifiedweve contact the vast majority of they if not all of themwho do not want to leave because they have sigtheyre dual national they have extend family et cetera and there s other who be look for the time so that s why we continueill take a few more question andbut you sirQ thank you Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I do not pick you but that s okay laughsq I want to ask youyou say that what America say matter what do you say to the Afghans who help troop who may not be able to get out by August 31st what the PRESIDENT I say Q what do you say to themTHE presidentwere go to continue to try to get you out it matterslook I know of no conflict as a student of historyno conflict where when a war be end one side be able to guarantee that everyone that want to be extract from that country would get out and think about it folk I think its important fori know the american people get this in their gut there be I would argue million of afghani citizen who be not Taliban who do not actively cooperate with we as siv who if give a chance they d be onboard a plane tomorrow it sound ridiculous but the vast majority of people in community like that want to come to America give a choiceSo get every single person out iscant be guarantee to anybody because there s a determination all who want to get out as wellAt any rate its a processi be really point to you butyou sirQ thank you Mr President there be report that US official provide the Taliban with name of Americans and afghan official to evacuate be you aware of that do that happenand then sir do you personally reject a recommendation to hold or to recapture Bagram Air Force BaseTHE PRESIDENT Heres what I ve do on theask thisIll answer the last question first on the tactical question of how to conduct an evacuation or a war I gather up all the major military personnel that be in Afghanistanthe commander as well as the Pentagon and I ask for their good military judgment what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the missionthey concludedthe militarythat Bagram be not much value add that it be much wise to focus on Kabul and so I follow that recommendation with regard tothere be certain circumstance where we ve get informationand quite frankly sometimes from some of yousaying you know of such and such a group of people who be try to get out and they re on a bus they re movingfrom other peopleand this be their locationand there have be occasion when our military have contact their military counterpart in the Taliban and say Thisfor example this bus be come through with x number of people on it make up of the follow group of people we want you to let that bus or that group through so yes there have be occasion like that and to the good of my knowledge in those case the bulk of that have occurredtheyve be let through but I can not tell you with any certitude that there s actually be a list of name I dontthere may have be but I know of no circumstance it do not mean its notit do not exist that here the name of 12 people they re come let they through it could very well have happen Ill take one more questionQ Mr President can I q Mr President right here Mr President the PRESIDENT whoa wait wait wait let I take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press Q thank you Mr President be thatis therethank youTHE PRESIDENT that s you LaughterQ Mr President there have not be a US service member kill in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020 you set a deadline you pull troop out you send troop back in and now 12 Marines be dead you say the buck stop with you do you bear any responsibility for the way that thing have unfold in the last two weeksthe PRESIDENT I bear responsibility for fundamentally all that s happen of lateBut here the deal you knowI wish you d one day say these thingsyou know as well as I do that the former President make a deal with the Taliban that he would get all american force out of Afghanistan by May 1in return the commitment be madeand that be a year beforein return he be give a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack other but would not attack any american force remember that I m be serious Q Mr President the PRESIDENT no IIm ask you a question be abecause before I Q Donald Trump be not the President right nowTHE PRESIDENT no nonow wait a minute I m ask you a question be thatis that accurate to the good of your knowledgeQ I know what you re talk about but Mr President respectfullyTHE PRESIDENT WhatQsinceI do not think that the issue thatdo you think that people have an issue with pull out of Afghanistan or just the way that thing have happen the PRESIDENT I think they have an issue that people be likely to get hurtsome as we ve see have get killedand that it be messythe reason whywhether my friend will acknowledge it and wasreporte itthe reason why there be no attack on Americans as you say from the date until I come into office be because the commitment be make by President Trump I will be out by May 1st in the meantime you agree not to attack any Americans that be the deal that s why no American be attackedQ and you say that you stilla few day ago you say you squarely stand by your decision to pull outTHE PRESIDENT yes I do because look at it this way folksand I m go toi have another meeting for real but imagine where we d be if I have indicate on May the 1st I be not go to renegotiate an evacuation date we be go to stay thereid have only one alternative Pour thousand of more troop back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we have already win relativeis why the reason we go in the first placeI have never be of the view that we should be sacrifice american life to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistana country that have never once in its entire history be a united country and be make upand I do not mean this in a derogatorymade up of different tribe who have never ever ever get along with one anotherand so as I say beforeand this be the last comment Ill make but well have more chance to talk about this unfortunately beyond because be not out yetif Osama bin Laden as well as al Qaeda have choose to launch an attackwhen they leave Saudi Arabiaout of Yemen would we have ever go to Afghanistan even though the Taliban completely control Afghanistan at the time would we have ever gonei know its not fair to ask you question its rhetorical but raise your hand if you think we should have go and give up thousand of life and ten of thousand of woundedour interest in go be to prevent al Qaeda from reemergingfirst to get bin Laden wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan and prevent that from happen againAs I ve say 100 time Terrorism have metastasize around the world we have great threat come out of other country a heck of a lot close to the United States we do not have military encampment there we do not keep people there we have overthehorizon capability to keep they from go after we Ladies and gentleman it be time to end a 20year warthank you so much
14 	 2021-08-16 	 the PRESIDENT Good afternoon I want to speak today to the unfold situation in Afghanistan the development that have take place in the last week and the step be take to address the rapidly evolve eventsmy national security team and I have be closely monitor the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and move quickly to execute the plan we have put in place to respond to every constituency includingand contingencyinclude the rapid collapse be see nowIll speak more in a moment about the specific step be take but I want to remind everyone how we get here and what america interest be in AfghanistanWe go to Afghanistan almost 20 year ago with clear goal get those who attack we on September 11th 2001 and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack we againWe do that we severely degrade al Qaeda in Afghanistan we never give up the hunt for Osama bin Laden and we get he that be a decade ago our mission in Afghanistan be never suppose to have be nation build it be never suppose to be create a unified centralize democracyOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remain today what it have always be prevent a terrorist attack on American homelandIve argue for many year that our mission should be narrowly focus on counterterrorismnot counterinsurgency or nation building that s why I oppose the surge when it be propose in 2009 when I be Vice PresidentAnd that s why as President I be adamant that we focus on the threat we face today in 2021not yesterday threatstoday the terrorist threat have metastasize well beyond Afghanistan al Shabaab in Somalia al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula alNusra in Syria ISIS attempt to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establish affiliate in multiple country in Africa and Asia these threat warrant our attention and our resourcesWe conduct effective counterterrorism mission against terrorist group in multiple country where we do not have a permanent military presenceif necessary we will do the same in Afghanistan we ve develop counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow we to keep our eye firmly fix on any direct threat to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if neededwhen I come into office I inherit a deal that President Trump negotiate with the Taliban under his agreement US force would be out of Afghanistan by May 1 2021just a little over three month after I take officeus force have already draw down during the Trump administration from roughly 15500 american force to 2500 troop in country and the Taliban be at its strong militarily since 2001the choice I have to make as your President be either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fight the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting seasonthere would have be no ceasefire after May 1 there be no agreement protect our force after May 1 there be no status quo of stability without american casualty after May 1there be only the cold reality of either follow through on the agreement to withdraw our force or escalate the conflict and send thousand more american troop back into combat in Afghanistan lurch into the third decade of conflict I stand squarely behind my decision after 20 year I ve learn the hard way that there be never a good time to withdraw US forcesthat why we be still there we be cleareye about the risk we plan for every contingencybut I always promise the american people that I will be straight with you the truth be this do unfold more quickly than we have anticipatedSo what s happen Afghanistan political leader give up and flee the country the afghan military collapse sometimes without try to fightIf anything the development of the past week reinforce that end US military involvement in Afghanistan now be the right decision american troop can not and should not be fight in a war and die in a war that afghan force be not willing to fight for themselves we spend over a trillion dollar we train and equip an afghan military force of some 300000 strongincredibly well equippeda force large in size than the military of many of our NATO ally we give they every tool they could need we pay their salary provide for the maintenance of their air forcesomethe the Taliban do not have Taliban do not have an air force we provide close air support we give they every chance to determine their own future what we could not provide they be the will to fight for that futurethere some very brave and capable afghan special force unit and soldier but if Afghanistan be unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now there be no chance that 1 year1 more year 5 more year or 20 more year of US military boot on the ground would ve make any differenceand here what I believe to my core it be wrong to order american troop to step up when Afghanistans own armed force would not if the political leader of Afghanistan be unable to come together for the good of their people unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chip be down they would never have do so while US troop remain in Afghanistan bear the brunt of the fighting for themAnd our true strategic competitorschina and russiawould love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billion of dollar in resource and attention into stabilize Afghanistan indefinitelyWhen I host President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I speak by phone to Ghani in July we have very frank conversation we talk about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil war after the US military depart to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the afghan people we talk extensively about the need for afghan leader to unite politically they fail to do any of thati also urge they to engage in diplomacy to seek a political settlement with the Taliban this advice be flatly refuse Mr Ghani insist the afghan force would fight but obviously he be wrongSo I m leave again to ask of those who argue that we should stay how many more generation of Americas daughter and son would you have I send to fight AfghansAfghanistans civil war when afghan troop will not how many more livesamerican livesis it worth how many endless row of headstone at Arlington National CemeteryIm clear on my answer I will not repeat the mistake we ve make in the pastthe mistake of stay and fight indefinitely in a conflict that be not in the national interest of the United States of double down on a civil war in a foreign country of attempt to remake a country through the endless military deployment of US forcesThose be the mistake we can not continue to repeat because we have significant vital interest in the world that we can not afford to ignoreI also want to acknowledge how painful this be to so many of we the scene be see in Afghanistan they re gutwrenche particularly for our veteran our diplomat humanitarian worker for anyone who have spend time on the ground work to support the Afghan peoplefor those who have lose love one in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fight and serve in the countryserve our country in Afghanistanthis be deeply deeply personalit be for I as well I ve work on these issue as long as anyone I ve be throughout Afghanistan during this warwhile the war be go onfrom Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar ValleyIve travel there on four different occasion I meet with the people I ve speak to the leader I spend time with our troop and I come to understand firsthand what be and be not possible in AfghanistanSo now be fercu sicfocuse on what be possible we will continue to support the afghan people we will lead with our diplomacy our international influence and our humanitarian aidwell continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instabilitywell continue to speak out for the basic right of the afghan peopleof woman and girlsjust as we speak out all over the worldi have be clear that human right must be the center of our foreign policy not the periphery but the way to do it be not through endless military deployment its with our diplomacy our economic tool and rally the world to join we now let I lay out the current mission in Afghanistan I be ask to authorizeand I did6000 US troop to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assist in the departure of US and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan and to evacuate our afghan ally and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of AfghanistanOur troop be work to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flight be take over air traffic control we have safely shut down our embassy and transfer our diplomat our dipour diplomatic presence be now consolidate at the airport as wellover the come day we intend to transport out thousand of american citizen who have be live and work in AfghanistanWell also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnelthe civilian personnel of our ally who be still serve in AfghanistanOperation Allies Refugee Refuge which I announce back in July have already move 2000 Afghans who be eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their family to the United StatesIn the come day the US military will provide assistance to move more siveligible Afghans and their family out of AfghanistanWere also expand refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who work for our embassy US nongovernmental agenciesor the US nongovernmental organization and Afghans who otherwise be at great risk and US news agenciesi know that there be concern about why we do not begin evacuate Afghanscivilians soon part of the answer be some of the Afghans do not want to leave earlierstill hopeful for their country and part of it be because the afghan government and its supporter discourage we from organize a mass exodus to avoid trigger as they say a crisis of confidenceamerican troop be perform this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do but it be not without risksAs we carry out this departure we have make it clear to the Taliban if they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation the US presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful we will defend our people with devastating force if necessaryour current military mission will be short in time limit in scope and focus in its objective get our people and our ally to safety as quickly as possible and once we have complete this mission we will conclude our military withdrawal we will end Americas long war after 20 long year of bloodshedthe event be see now be sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable united and secure afghanistana know in history as the graveyard of empireswhat be happen now could just as easily have happen 5 year ago or 15 year in the future we have to be honest our mission in Afghanistan have take many misstepsmade many misstep over the past two decade I m now the fourth american President to preside over war in Afghanistantwo Democrats and two Republicans I will not pass this responsibly onresponsibility on to a fifth PresidentI will not mislead the american people by claim that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we be today and how we must move forward from hereI be President of the United States of America and the buck stop with meI be deeply sadden by the fact we now face but I do not regret my decision to end Americas warfighte in Afghanistan and maintain a laserfocus on our counterterrorism mission there and in other part of the worldOur mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden be a successour decadeslong effort to overcome century of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan be not and I write and believe it never could beI can not and I will not ask our troop to fight on endlessly in anotherin another country civil war take casualty suffer lifeshattere injury leave family break by grief and lossthis be not in our national security interest it be not what the american people want it be not what our troop who have sacrifice so much over the past two decade deserveI make a commitment to the american people when I run for President that I would bring Americas military involvement in Afghanistan to an end and while its be hard and messyand yes far from perfective honor that commitmentmore importantly I make a commitment to the brave man and woman who serve this nation that I be not go to ask they to continue to risk their life in a military action that should have end long ago our leader do that in Vietnam when I get here as a young man I will not do it in AfghanistanI know my decision will be criticize but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United Statesyet another onea fifth one because its the right oneit the right decision for our people the right one for our brave service member who have risk their life serve our nation and its the right one for America so thank you may God protect our troop our diplomat and all of the brave Americans serve in harm way

to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from become a base from which attack could be continue against the United States we achieve those objective that s why we wentwe do not go to

will stand with you just as you stand with uswhen I make the decision to end the US military involvement in Afghanistan I judge that it be not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fight this war indefinitely I make the decision with clear eye and I be brief daily on the battlefield updatesbut for those who have argue that we should stay just six more month or just one more year I ask they to consider the lesson of recent historyIn 2011 the NATO Allies and partner agree that we would end our combat mission in 2014 in 2014 some argue one more year so we keep fight and we keep take casualty in 2015 the same and on and onnearly 20 year of experience have show we that the current security situation only confirm that just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan be not a solution but a recipe for be there indefinitelyits up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their countryother be more direct their argument be that we should stay with the Afghanin Afghanistan indefinitely in do so they point to the fact that wewe have not take loss in this last year so they claim that the cost of just maintain the status quo be minimalbut that ignore the reality and the fact that already present on the ground in Afghanistan when I take office the Taliban be at its strong mili at its strong militarily since 2001the number of US force in Afghanistan have be reduce to a bare minimum and the United States in the last administration make an agreement that thewith the Taliban to remove all our force by May 1 of this pastof this year that s what I inherit that agreement be the reason the Taliban have cease major attack against US forcesIf in April I have instead announce that the United States be go to backgoe back on that agreement make by the last administrationthat the United States and ally force would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable futurethe Taliban would have again begin to target our forcesthe status quo be not an option staying would have mean US troop take casualty american man and woman back in the middle of a civil war and we would have run the risk of have to send more troop back into Afghanistan to defend our remain troopsonce that agreement with the Taliban have be make stay with a bare minimum force be no long possibleSo let I ask those who want we to stay how many morehow many thousand more of Americas daughter and son be you willing to risk how long would you have they stayalready we have member of our military whose parent fight in Afghanistan 20 year ago would you send their child and their grandchild as well would you send your own son or daughterafter 20 yearsa trillion dollar spend training and equip hundred of thousand of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces 2448 Americans kill 20722 more wounded and untold thousand come home with unseen trauma to their mental healthI will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieve a different outcomeThe United States can not afford to remain tethered to policy create a response to a world as it be 20 year ago we need to meet the threat where they be todaytoday the terrorist threat have metastasize beyond Afghanistan so we be reposition our resource and adapt our counterterrorism posture to meet the threat where they be now significantly high in South Asia the Middle East and africabut make no mistake our military and intelligence leader be confident they have the capability to protect the homeland and our interest from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerge or emanating from AfghanistanWe be develop a counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow we to keep our eye firmly fix on any direct threat to the United States in the region and act quickly and decisively if neededAnd we also need to focus on shore up Americas core strength to meet the strategic competition with China and other nation that be really go to determinedetermine our futureWe have to defeat covid19 at home and around the world make sure be well prepare for the next pandemic or biological threatWe need to establish international norm for cyberspace and the use of emergencemerge technologiesWe need to take concert action to fight existential threat of climate changeand we will be more formidable to our adversary and competitor over the long run if we fight the battle of the next 20 year not the last 20 yearsfinally I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the US military and civilian personnel serve alongside our Allies and partner have make over the last two decade in AfghanistanI want to honor the significance of what they ve accomplish and the great personal risk they encounter and the incredible cost to their family pursue the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planetand I ve be almost throughout that entire country ensure there have not be another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 year take out Bin ladeni want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have give and to the sacrifice that you and your family have make over the long course of this warwell never forget those who give the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan nor those whose life have be immeasurably alter by wound sustain in service to their countryWere end Americas long war but well always always honor the bravery of the american patriot who serve in itmay God bless you all and may God protect our troop thank youq Mr Presidentdo you trust the Taliban Mr presidentq be a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitablethe PRESIDENT no it be notq WhyTHE PRESIDENT because youthe afghan troop have 300000 wellequippeda wellequippe as any army in the worldand an air force against something like 75000 Taliban it be not inevitableq do you trust the Taliban Mr President do you trust the Taliban sirTHE PRESIDENT Youis that a serious questionq it be absolutely a serious question do you trust the talibanthe PRESIDENT no I do notq do you trust handing over the country to the talibanthe PRESIDENT no I do not trust the TalibanQ so why be you hand the country overQ Mr President be the US responsible for the death of Afghans after you leave the countryQ Mr President will you amplify that question please will you amplify your answer pleasewhy you do not trust the talibanthe PRESIDENT its ait a silly question do I trust the Taliban no but I trust the capacity of the afghan military who be well train well equip and more remore competent in term of conduct warYes maamQ thank you Mr President give the amount of money that have be spend and the number of life that have be lose in your view with make this decision be the last 20 year worth itTHE PRESIDENT you know my record I can tell by the way you ask the questionI oppose permanently have american force in Afghanistan I argue from the beginning as you may recallit come to light after the administration be over lastour administrationno nation have ever unify Afghanistan no nation empire have go there and not do itthe focus we hadand I strongly support itand you may remember I physically go to Afghanistan I be up in that pass where Osama bin Laden wasallegedly escape orout of harm wayWe go for two reason one to bring Osama bin Laden to the gate of hell as I say at the time the second reason be to eliminate al Qaedas capacity to deal with more attack on the United States from that territory we accomplish both of those objectivesperiodthat what I believe from the beginning why we should be and why we should have go to Afghanistan that job have be over for some time and that s why I believe that this be the right decision and quite frankly overdueQ Mr President have the civilian government hail the people of afghanistanq Mr President thank you very much your own intelligence community have assess that the afghan government will likely collapsethe PRESIDENT that be not trueq be itcan you please clarify what they have tell you about whether that will happen or notTHE PRESIDENT that be not true they do notthey didntdid not reach that conclusionQ so what be the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapsethe PRESIDENT the afghan government and leadership have to come together they clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place the question be will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it its not a question of whether they have the capacity they have the capacity they have the force they have the equipment the question be will they do itand I want to make clear what I make clear to Ghani that we be not go just suswalk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force we be be go to also work to make sure we help they in term of everything from food necessity and other thing inin the region Butbut there s not a conclusion that in fact they can not defeat the TalibanI believe the only way there s go to bethis be now Joe Biden not the intelligence communitythe only way there s ultimately go to be peace and security in Afghanistan be that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peaceAnd the likelihood there s go to be one unified government in Afghanistan control the whole country be highly unlikelyq Mr President thank you but we have talk to your own top general in Afghanistan General Scott Miller he tell ABC News the condition be so concern at this point that it could result in a civil war so if Kabul fall to the Taliban what will the United States do about itTHE PRESIDENT Look you ve say two thingsone that if it could result in a civil warthat different than the Taliban succeed number one number two the question of what will be do be go to be implicatedi go to implicate the entire region as well there s a number of country who have a grave concern about what s go to happen in Afghanistan relative to their securitythe question be how much of a threat to the United States of America and to our ally be whatever result in term of a government or an agreement that s when that judgement will be madeQ Mr President some vietnamese veteran see echo of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan do you see any parallel between this withdrawal and what happen in Vietnam with some people feel the PRESIDENT None whatsoever Zero what you have isyou have entire brigade break through the gate of our embassysix if I m not mistakenThe Taliban be not the souththe north vietnamese army they re nottheyre not remotely comparable in term of capability there s go to be no circumstance where you see people be lift off the roof of an embassy in theof the United States from Afghanistan it be not at all comparableq and Mr President Q Mr President can I the PRESIDENT Ill take he and then Illand then Ill goill go to the other side Hang on a secondq Mr President how serious be the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission fail therethe PRESIDENT well first of all the mission have not fail yet there be in Afghanistanin all party there s be corruption the question be can there be an agreement on unity of purpose what be the objectivefor example it start offthere be go to be negotiation between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the afghan government thatthat ofit do not come toit do not come to fruitionSo the question now be where do they go from here Thatthe jury be still out but the likelihood there s go to be the Taliban overrun everything and own the whole country be highly unlikelyYes maamQ Mr President will the United States be responsible for the loss of afghan civilian live that could happen after a the PRESIDENT NoQmilitary exitTHE PRESIDENT no no no its up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want not we to impose the government on they no country have ever be able to do thatkeep in mind as a student of history as I m sure you be never have Afghanistan be a united country not in all of its history not in all of its historyq Mr President if this be not a mission accomplish moment what be it in your viewthe PRESIDENT no there s no mission accomplishedq how would you describe itTHE PRESIDENT the mission be accomplish in that we getgot Osama bin Laden and terrorism be not emanate from that part of the worldQ Mr President if speed be safety as you just say in your remark be you satisfied with the timeline of relocate afghan national be it happen quickly enough to your satisfaction if it may not happen until next month at the endTHE president Well much of it have already happen there s already be peopleabout a thousand people have get on aircraft and come homecome to the United States already on commercial aircraft so as I say there s over 2500 people that asfrom January to now have get those visa and only half decide that they want to leavethe point be that I think the whole process have to be speed up period in term of be able to get these visasq why can not the US evacuate these afghan translator to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrant at the southern border have be allow to dothe PRESIDENT because the law do not allow that to happen and that s why be ask the Congress to consider change the lawbut in the meantime we can guarantee their safety if they wish to leave by take they to third country andor while the wait be take place to come totoand hopefully while they re wait there to be able to bring they back to the United States if that s what they choose to doq and what do you makeand what do you make sir of the Taliban be in Russia todayQ Mr President I m from Afghanistan I be afghan inaudible woman any messagegood message for afghan woman in future because they have achievementthey be really concerned about their achievementthe PRESIDENT they be very concerned with good reasonQ YesTHE PRESIDENT when I be in AfghanistanIve be there a number of timesi remember be in a school outside andand by the way the school in Afghanistan be not fundamentally unlike school in the West Coast where they have you know aan area in the middle that be sort of likeit look like a playground and singlestory building connect around itand I remember say tospeake to a group of young womeni guess they be roughlydont hold I to thisthey look like they d be 14 15 year old and they re in school and there s a tiered classroom with single light bulb hang from the ceiling as I know you knowand I say you know the United States come here to make sure that we get this terrorist Osama bin Laden and that terrorist do not amass again toto go after our country and then be go to have to leave and a young woman say you can not leave you can not leave it wasit be heartbreaking you can not leave she say I want to be a doctor I want to be a doctor I want to be a doctor if you leave Ill never be able to be a doctor well that s why we spend so much time and money train the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defend that if every work well anywayso yes I m awareIm go to take one more questionQ Mr President have you speak with any Taliban official about the withdrawalQ Inaudible the Taliban be in Russia todaythe Taliban Q MrMr President Ithank you I want to ask with the benefit of hindsight you ve speak to the fact that the Taliban be sort of at their militarily strong point that you ve see in 20 year how do you feel personally about that with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollar and investment and american troop that be send therethe PRESIDENT Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police they re not even close in term of their capacityi be make the pointthe point be that here we be I wasthe argument be well we could stay because no one be die no Americans be be shoot so why leave once the agreement be make by the last administration that we be go to leave by May 1st it be very clear that a Taliban that have always be a problem be even a more sophisticated problem than they be than before not more sophisticated than the ANSF the government More than they wereThe point be that it would have increase the prospect that they would have be able to take more life of Americans if they decide we be not go to go after they that be the point I be makingthank you all so very much thank you

Americans this be not a riot this be a massacreapplauseamong the bad in our history but not the only one and for too long forget by our historyAs soon as it happen there be a clear effort to erase it from our memoryour collective memoriesfrom the news and everyday conversation for a long time school in Tulsa do not even teach it let alone school elsewhereAnd most people do not realize that a century ago a second Ku Klux Klan have be foundedthe second Ku Klux Klan have be foundeda friend of mine Jon MeachamI have writtenwhen I say I be run to restore the soul of America he write a book call the Soul of Americanot because of what I say and there s a picture about page 160 in his book show over 30000 Ku Klux Klan member in full regalia Reverendpointed hat the robesmarching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC Jesse you know all about this WashinWashington DCIf my memory be correct there be 37 member of the House of Representatives who be open member of the Klan there be five if I m not mistakenit could have be seven I think it be fivemember of the United States Senateopen member of the Klan multiple governor who be open member of the KlanMost people do not realize that a century ago the Klan be found just six year before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa and one of the reason why it be found be because of guy like I who be catholic it be not about African Americans then it be about make sure that all those polish and irish and italian and Eastern European Catholics who come to the United States after World War one would not pollute ChristianityThe flame from those burn crosse torch every regionregion of the country Millions of white Americans belong to the Klan and they be not even embarrassed by it they be proud of itand that hate became embed systematically and systemically in our law and our culture we do ourselves no favor by pretend none of this ever happen or that it do not impact we today because it do still impact we todayWe can not just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know applause we should know the good the bad everything that s what great nation do they come to term with their dark side and be a great nationthe only way to build a common ground be to truly repair and to rebuild I come here to help fill the silence because in silence wound deepen applause and onlyas painful as it be only in remembrance do wound heal we just have to choose to rememberWe memorialize what happen here in Tulsa so it can be so it can not be erase we know here in this hallowed place we simply can not bury pain and trauma foreverAnd at some point there will be a reckoning an inflection point like be face right now as a nationwhat many people have not see before or haor simply refuse to see can not be ignore any long you see it in so many place and there s great recognition that for too long we ve allow a narrow cramp view of the promise of this nation to festerthe view that America be a zerosum game where there be only one winner if you succeed I fail if you get ahead I fall behind if you get a job I lose mine and maybe bad of all if I hold you down I lift myself up instead of if you do well we all do well applause we see that in greenwoodthis story be not about the loss of life but a loss of living of wealth and prosterity prosperity and possibility that still reverberate todaymother Fletcher talk about how she be only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually find work in the shipyard as a domestic workerMr Van Ellis have share how even after enlist and serve in World War Two he still come home to struggle with a segregated AmericaImagine all those hotel and dinner diner and momandpop shop that could beenhave be pass down this past hundred year imagine what could have be do for black family in Greenwood financial security and generational wealthIf you come from background like mymy familya workingclass middleclass familythe only way we be ever able to generate any wealth be in equity in our home imagine what they contribute then and what they could ve contribute all these year imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred year what that would ve mean for all of Tulsa include the white communitywhile the people of Greenwood rebuild again in the year after the massacre it do not last eventually neighborhood be redline on map lock Black Tulsa out of homeownerships Applause a highway be build right through the heart of the community Lisa I be talk about our west sidewhat 95 do to it after we be occupy by the military after Dr King be murder the communitycutting off black family and business from job and opportunity Chronic underinvestment from state and federal government deny Greenwood even just a chance at rebuild ApplauseWe must find the courage to change the thing we know we can change that s what Vice President Harris and I be focus on along with our entire administration include our Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge who be here today ApplauseBecause today be announce two expand effort target toward black wealth creation that will also help the entire community the first be my administration have launch an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing that include everything from redline to the cruel fact that a home own by a black family be too often appraise at a low value than a similar home own by a white family ApplauseAnd I might addand I need help if you have an answer to this I can not figure this one out Congressman Horsford but if you live in a black community and there s another one on the other side of the highwayit a white community its thebuilt by the same builder and you have a well driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community yourecan pay more for your auto insurance shockingly the percentage of black american homeownership be low today in America than when the Fair Housing Act be pass more than 50 year ago lower today that s wrong and be commit to change thatjust imagine if instead of deny million of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth we make it possible for they to buy a home and build equity into thatinto that home and provide for their familiessecond small business be the engine of our economy and the glue of our community as President my administration oversee hundred of billion of dollar in federal contract for everything from refurbish deck of aircraft carrier to instal railing in federal building to professional servicesWe have a thing calledI will not go into it all because there s not enough time now but I m determined to use every taxpayer dollar that be assign to I to spend go to american company and american worker to build Ameri to build american product and as part of that I m go to increase the share of the dollar the federal government spend to small disadvantaged business include black and brown small businessesRight now it call for 10 percent I m go to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spend will be spend inaudible applause I have the authority to do that just imagine if instead of deny million of entrepreneur the ability to access capital and contracting we make it possible to take their dream to the marketplace to create job and invest in our communitiesThatthe data show young black entrepreneur be just as capable of succeed give the chance as white entrepreneur be but they do not have lawyer they do not havetheythey do not have accountant but they have great idea do anyone doubt this whole nation would be well off from the investment those people make and I promise you that s why I set up thea national Small Business Administration that s much broad because they re go to get those loan instead of consign million of american child to underresourced school let give each and every child three and four year old access to schoolnot daycare school ApplauseIn the last 10 year study have be do by all the great university it show that if increase by 56 percent the possibility of a childno matter what background they come from no matter whatif they start school at three year old they have a 56 percent chance of go all through all 12 year without any trouble and be able to do well and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their livesand let unlock more thanan incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation Historically Black Colleges and Universities Applause I have a 5 billion program give they the resource to invest in research center and laboratory and highdemand field to compete for the goodpaying job in industry likeof the future like cybersecuritythe reason why they donttheirtheir student be equally able to learn as well and get the goodpaying job that start at 90 and 100000 buck but they do not havethey do not have the backthey do not have the money to provide and build those laboratory so guess what they re go to get the money to build those laboratory applause so instead of just talk about infrastructure let get about theabout the business of actually rebuild road and highway fill the sidewalk and crack instal streetlight and highspee internet create spacespace to live and work and play safelylet ensure access to healthcare clean water clean air nearby grocery storesstock the fresh vegetable and food thatapplausein fact deal withI mean these be all thing we can dodoe anyone doubt this whole nation would be well off with these investment the rich will be just as well off the middle class will do well and everybody will do well its about goodpaye job financial stability and be able to build some generational wealth its about economic growth for our country and outcompete the rest of the world which be now outcompete usbut just as fundamental as any of these investment I ve discussedthis may be the most fundamental the right to vote applause the right to vote applausea lot of the member of the Black Caucus know John Lewis well than I do but I know he on his deathbed like many I call John to speak to he but all John want to do be talk about how I be do he die I think about 25 hour later but you know what John say he call the right to vote precious almost sacred he say the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic societythis sacred right be under assault with an incredible intensity like I ve never seeneven though I get start as a public defender and a civil right lawyerwith an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not see in a long long time its simply unamerican it be not however sadly unprecedented the creed we shall Overcome be a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement as Jesse Jackson can tell you well than anybodyThe obstacle to procto progress that have to be overcome be a constant challenge we see it in the 60 but with the current assault its not just an echo of a distant history in 2020 we face a tireless assault on the right to vote restrictive law lawsuit threat of intimidation voter purge and more we resolve to overcome it all and we do More Americans vote in the last election than anyin the midst of a pandemicthan any election in american history applause you get voter register you get voter to the poll the rule of law hold Democracy prevail we overcome but today let I be unequivocal I ve be engage in this work my whole career and be go to be ramp up our effort to overcome again I will have more to say about this at a later datethe truly unprecedented assault on our democracy an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrator and to intimidate those charge with tally and report the election result but today as for the act of vote itself I urge voting right group in this country to begin to redouble their effort now to register and educate voter applause and in JuneJune should be a month of action on Capitol Hill I hear all the folk on tv say why do not Biden get this do well because Biden only have a majority of effectively four vote in the House and a tie in the Senate with two member of the Senate who vote more with my republican friend but be not give up early this year the House of Representatives pass for the People Act to protect our democracy the Senate will take it up later this month and I m go to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passageThe House be also work on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act which iswhich be criticalapplauseto provide new legal tool to combat the new assault on the right to vote to signify the importance of our effort today I m ask Vice President Harris to help these effort and lead they among her many other responsibility with her leadership and your support be go to overcome again I promise you but its go to take a hell of a lot of work ApplauseAnd finally we have toand finally we must address what remain the stain on the soul of America what happen in Greenwood be an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exist today still just close your eye and remember what you see in Charlottesville four year ago on television NeoNazis white supremacist the KKK come out of those field at night in Virginia with light torchesthe vein bulge on theira they be scream remember just close your eye and picture what it waswell Mother Fletcher say when she see the insurrection at the

railroad the interstate highway unite two ocean and bring a totally new age of progress to the United States of AmericaUniversal public school and college aid open wide the door of opportunityscientific breakthrough take we to the Moonnow be on Mars discover vaccine give we the internet and so much moreThese be the investment we make together as one country and investment that only the government be in a position to make Time and again they propel we into the futurethat why I propose the American Jobs Plana onceinageneration investment in America itself this be the large job plan since World War TwoIt create job to upgrade our transportation infrastructure job modernize our road bridge highway job build port and airport rail corridor transit line its clean water and today up to 10 million home in America and more than 400000 school and childcare center have pipe with lead in they include in drink watera clear and present danger to our children healthThe American Jobs Plan create job replace 100 percent of the nation lead pipe and service line so every American can drink clean water ApplauseAnd in the process it will create thousand and thousand of goodpaying job it create job connect every American with highspeed Internet include 35 percent of the rural America that still do not have itthis be go to help our kid and our business succeed in the 21stcentury economyand I be ask the Vice President to lead this effort if she would the vice PRESIDENT of courseTHE PRESIDENTbecause I know it will get do ApplauseIt create job build a modern power grid our grid

this plan be go to help those family and create job for our caregiver with well wage and well benefit continue a cycle of growthfor too long we ve fail to use the most important word when it come to meet the climate crisis job Jobs Jobs Applause for I when I think climate change I think jobsThe American Jobs Plan will put engineer and construction worker to work build more energyefficient building and home electrical workersIBEW membersinstalle 500000 charge station along our highway so we can ownapplauseso we can own the electric car market ApplauseFarmersfarmers planting cover crop

of Beijing no reason None no reason ApplauseSo folk there s no reason why AmericanAmerican worker can not lead the world in the production of electric vehicle and battery I mean there be no reason we have this capacity applause we have the bright besttraine people in the worldThe American Jobs Plan be go to create million of goodpaying jobsjob Americans can raise a family ona my dad would then say with a little breathing roomAnd all the investment in the American Jobs Plan will be guide by one principle Buy American Applause Buy americanand I might note parentheticallyapplausethat do notthat do not violate any trade agreement its be the law since the 30 buy american american tax dollar be go to be use to buy american product make in America to create american job that s the way its suppose to be and it will be in this administration ApplauseAnd I make it clear to all my Cabinet people their ability to give exemption have be exstrenuously sic limit it will be american productsNow I know some of you at home be wonder whether these job be for you so many of youso many of the folk I grow up with feel leave behind forget in an economy that s so rapidly change its frightening I want to speak directly to you because if you think about it that s what people be most worried about can I fit inindependent expert estimate the American Jobs Plan will add million of job and trillion of dollar to economic growth in the year to come it be ait be an eightyear program these be goodpaye job that can not be outsourcednearly 90 percent of the infrastructure job create in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree 75 percent do not require an associate degreethe American Jobs Plan be a bluecollar blueprint to build America that s what it be ApplauseAnd it recognize something I ve always say in this chamber and the other good guy and woman on Wall Street but Wall Street do not build this country the middle class build the country and union build the middle class ApplauseSo that s why I m call on Congress to pass the protect the right to organize actthe PRO Actand send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize ApplauseAnd by the way while you re think about send thing to my desklaughslet raise the minimum wage to 15 applauseno oneno one work 40 hour a weekno one work 40 hour a week should live below the poverty lineWe need to ensure great equity and opportunity for woman and while be do this let get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as wellequal pay its be much too long and if you re wonder whether its too long look behind I ApplauseAnd finally the American Jobs Plan will be the big increase in nondefense research and development on record we will see more technological changeand some of you know more about this than I dowell see more technological change in the next 10 year than we see in the last 50 that s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more be changingand be fall behind the competition with the rest of the worlddecade ago we use to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America2 percent of our gross domestic productin research and development today Mr Secretary that s less than 1 percent China and other country be close in fast we have to develop and dominate the product and technology of the futureadvance battery biotechnology computer chip clean energyThe Secretary of Defense can tell youand those of you onwho work on national security issue knowthe Defense Department have an agency call DARPAthe Defense Advanced Research Project Agency the people who set up before I come hereand that s be a long time agoto develop breakthrough that enhance our national security that s their only job and its a semiseparate agency its under the Defense Department its lead to everything from the discovery of the internet to gps and so much more that have enhance our securityThe National Institute of Healththe NIH I believe should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health ApplauseAnd that wouldhere what it would do it would have a singular purpose to develop breakthrough to prevent detect and treat disease like Alzheimers diabete and cancerill still never forget when we pass the cancer proposal the last year I be Vice Presidentalmost 9 million go to NIH and if you excuse the point of personal privilege Ill never forget you stand and mentioningsaye you d name it after my deceased son it mean a lotbut so many of we have decease son daughter and relative who die of cancer I can think of no more worthy investment I know of nothing that be more bipartisan so let end cancer as we know it applause its within our power applause its within our power to do it ApplauseInvestments in job and infrastructure like the one be talk about have often have bipartisan support in the past Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan and I applaud a group of republican senator who just put forward their own proposalSo let get to work I want to lay out before the Congress my plan before we get into the deep discussion I d like to meet with those who have idea that be differentthey think be well I welcome those idea but the rest of the world be not wait for we I just want to be clear from my perspective do nothing be not an option ApplauseLook we can not be so busy compete with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st centurysecretary Blinken can tell you I spend a lot of time with President Xitraveled over 17000 mile with he spend they tell I over 24 hour in private discussion with he when he call to congratulate I we have a twohour discussion he s deadly earnest about become the most significant consequential nation in the world he and othersautocratsthink that democracy can not compete in the 21st century with autocracy because it take too long to get consensus to win that competition for the future in my view we also need to make a onceinageneration investment in our family and our child that s why I ve introduce the American Families Plan tonight which address four of the big challenge face american family and in turn AmericaFirst be access to a good education when this nation make 12 year of public education universal in the last century it make we the besteducate bestprepared nation in the world its I believe the overwhelming reason that propel we to where we get in the 21stin the 20th century but the world have catch up or catch up they be not wait I would say parenthetically if we be sit down put a bipartisan committee together and say okay be go to decide what we do in term of government provide for free education I wonder whether we d think as we do in the 20th century that 12 year be enough in the 21st century I doubt it twelve year be no long enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st CenturyThats why my American Families Plan guarantee four additional year of public education for every person in America start as early as we canthe great university of this country have conduct study over the last 10 year it show that add two year of universal highquality preschool for every threeyearold and fouryearold no matter what background they come from it put they in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 year it increase exponentially their prospect of graduate and go on beyond graduationthe research show when a young child go to schoolnot daycarethey be far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high schoolwhen you add two year of free community college on top of that you begin to change the dynamic applause we can do that applause and well increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities Tribal Colleges MinorityServing institution the reason be they do not have the endowment but their student be just as capable of learn about cybersecurity just as capable of learn about metallurgyall the thing that be go on that provide those job of the futurejill be a community college professor who teach today as First Lady she have long saidapplause she have longapplause if I ve hear it once I ve hear it a thousand time Joe any country that outeducate we be go to outcompete we Shell be deeply involve in lead this effort thank you JillSecond thing we need American Families Plan will provide access to quality affordable childcare we guaranteeapplause and I m propose a legislation to guarantee that low and middleincome family will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for highquality care for child up to the age of 5 the most hardpressed work family will not have to spend a dimethird the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 week of pay leave and medical leavefamily and medical leave be one of the few industrial country in the worldapplause no one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or take care of themselves and their love one a parent a spouse or childAnd fourth the American Family Plan put directly into the pocket of million of Americans in March we expand a tax credit for every child in a family up to a 3000 per child if they re under over six year of agei mean excuse meunderover six year of age and 3600 for child over under six year of agewith two parent two kid that s 7200 in the pocket that s go to help to take care of your family and that will help more than 65 million child and help cut childcare child poverty in half applause and we can afford it so we do that in the recin thein the last piece of legislation we pass but let extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025 ApplauseThe American Rescue Plan lower healthcare premium for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act I know that s really popular on this side of the aisle Laughter but let make that provision permanent so their premium do not go back up applausein addition to my Families Plan I m go to work with Congress to address this year other critical priority for american family the Affordable Care Act have be a lifeline for million of Americans protect people with preexist condition protect women health and the pandemic have demonstrate how badlyhow badly its need Lets low deductible for work family on the Affordable Carein the Affordable Care Act Applause and let low prescription drug cost applause we know how to do this the last President have that as an objective we all know how outrageously expensive drug be in America in fact we pay the high prescription drug price of anywhere in the world right here in Americanearly three timesfor the same drug nearly three time what other country pay we have to change that and we can lets do what we ve always talk about for all the year I be down here in thisin this bodyin Congress Lets give Medicare the power to save hundred of billion of dollar by negotiate low drug prescription price ApplauseAnd by the way that will not justthat will not just help people on Medicare it will lower prescription drug cost for everyone and the money we save which be billion of dollar can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefit without cost taxpayer an additional penny its within our power to do it let do it now ApplauseWeve talk about it long enough Democrats and Republicans let get it do this year this be all about a simple premise Healthcare should be a right not a privilege in America Applause so how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan I make it clear we can do it without increase the deficit let start with what I will not do I will not impose any tax increase on people make less than 400000 Itsbut its time for corporate America and the wealthy 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share applause just their fair share sometimes I have argument with my friend in the Democratic Party I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire but pay your fair shareA recent study show that 55 of the nation big corporation pay zero federal tax last year those 55 corporation make in excess of 40 billion in profit a lot of company also evade taxis through tax haven in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and they benefit from tax loophole and deduction for offshore job and shift profit overseas its not right be go to reform corporate taxis so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investment their business will benefit from as well applausewere go to reward work not just wealth we take the top tax bracket for the wealthy 1 percent of Americansthose make over 400000 or moreback up to where it be when George W Bush be President when he start 396 percent that s where it be when George W be President be go to get rid of the loophole that allow Americans who make more than a million dollar a year and pay a low tax rate on their capital gain than Americans who receive a paycheck be only go to affect three tenth of 1 percent of all Americans by that action three tenth of 1 percent and the IRS be go to crack down on millionaire and billionaire who cheat on their taxis its estimate to be billion of dollar by think tank that be leave right and center I m not look to punish anybody but I will not add a tax burdenan additional tax burden to the middle class in this country they re already pay enough I believe what I propose be fairapplausefiscally responsible and it raise revenue to pay for the plan I have propose and will create million of job that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the countrywhen you hear someone say that they do not want to raise taxis on the wealthy 1 percent or corporate America ask they whose taxis you want to raise instead whose be you go to cut look the big tax cut of 2017remember it be suppose to pay for itselfthat be how it be soldand generate vast economic growth instead it add 2 trillion to the deficit it be a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very topInstead of use the tax saving to raise wage and invest in research and development it pour billion of dollar into the pocket of ceo in fact the pay gap between ceo and their worker be now among the large in history accord to one study ceo make 320 time what the average worker in their corporation make it use to be in thebelow a hundred the pandemic have only make thing bad twenty million Americans lose their job in the pandemicworking and middleclass Americans at the same time roughly 650 billionaire in America see their net worth increase by more than 1 trillionin the same exact period let I say it again 650 people increase their wealth by more than 1 trillion during this pandemic and they re now worth more than 4 trillion my fellow Americans trickledowntrickledown economic have never work and its time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out Applause you know there s a broad consensus of economistsleft right centerand they agree what I m propose will help create million of job and generate historic economic growth these be among the highestvalue investment we can make as a nation I ve often say our great strength be the power of our example not just the example of our powerIn my conversation with world leadersand I ve speak to over 38 40 of they nowIve make it knownIve make it know that America be back and you know what they say the comment that I hear most of all from they be they say we see America be back but for how long but for how longmy fellow Americans we have to show not just that be back but that be back to stay and that we be not go to go it alone applause be go to do it by lead with our ally applause no one nation can deal with all the crisis of our timefrom terrorism to nuclear proliferation mass migration cybersecurity climate change as well as experiwhat be experience now with pandemic there s no wall high enough to keep any virus out and our own vaccine supplyas it grow to meet our need and be meet themwill become an arsenal of vaccine for other country just as America be the arsenal of democracy for the worldapplauseand in consequence influence the world ApplauseBut every American will have access before that occurevery American will have access to be fully cover by COVID19from the vaccine we havelook the climate crisis be not our fight alone its a global fight the United States account as all of you know less than 15 percent of carbon emission the rest of the world account for 85 percent that s why I keep my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accordbecause if we do everything perfectly its not go to ultimately matteri keep my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economy of the worldChina Russia India the European Unionand I say I d do it in my first 100 daysI want to be very blunt about it I hadmy attempt be to make sure that the world could see there be a consensus that we be at an inflection point in history and consensusthe consensus be if we act to save the planet we can create million of job and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of live to almost everyone around the worldIf you ve watch any of itand you be all busy I m sure you do not have much timethat what virtually every nation say even the one that be not do their fair sharethe investment

intellectual propertyi also tell President Xi that well maintain a strong military presence in the IndoPacific just as we do with NATO in Europenot to start a conflict but to prevent one applause I tell he what I ve say to many world leader that America will not back away from our commitmentsour commitment to human right and fundamental freedom and to our alliancesand I point out to he no

will grow the economy make we more competitive around the world promote our national security interest and put we in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming year be it big yes be it bold yes and we can get it do it have two part the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan both be essential to our economic future in a few week Ill talk about the Americans Family Plan but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan Ill begin with the heart of the plan it modernize transportation infrastructure our road our bridge our airport I just leave your

road and main street that be in difficult difficult shape right now it ll fix the nation 10 most economically significant bridge in America that require replacement remember that bridge that go down we get 10 of the most economically significant bridge with more commerce go across it that need to be replace well also repair 10000 bridge desperately need upgrade to unclog traffic keep people safe and connect our city town and tribe across the country the American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridor and transit line ease congestion cut pollution slash commute time and opening up investment in community that can be connect to the city and city to the outskirt where a lot of job be these day it ll reduce the bottleneck of commerce at our port and our airport the American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with american job and american ingenuity it ll protect our community from billion of dollar of damage from historic super storm flood wildfire drought year after year by make our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seize incredible opportunity for american worker and american farmer in a clean energy future skilled worker like one we just hear from build a nationwide network of 500000 charge station create goodpaying job by lead the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric car and truck be go to provide tax incentive and pointofsale rebert sic rebate to help all american family afford clean vehicle of the future the federal government own an enormous fleet of vehicle which be go to be transition to clean electric vehicle and hydrogen vehicle right here in the United States by american worker with american product when we make all these investment be go to make sure as the executive order I sign early on that we buy American that mean invest in americanbase company and american worker not a contract will go out that I control that will not go to a company that be an american company with american product all the way down the line and american worker and well buy the good we need from all of America community that have historically be leave out of these investment Black Latino asian american native american rural small business entrepreneur across the country look today up to 10 million home in America and more than 400000 school and childcare center have pipe where they get their water from pipe that be leadbase pipe include pipe for drink water accord to scientist there be simply no safe exposure to lead for a child Lead can slow development cause learn behavior and hear problem the American Jobs Plan will put plumber and pipefitter to work replace 100 percent of the nation lead pipe and service line so every American every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water with each 5000 investment replace a line that can mean up to 22000 in healthcare cost save a chance to protect our child help they learn and thrive we can not delay we can not delay another minute its long past due you know in America where the early interest be in internet this thing call the internet that we invest we invent the early the early internet be invent here million of Americans though lack access to reliable highspeed internet include more than 35 percent of rural America its a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic American Jobs will make sure every single every single american have access to high quality affordable highspeed Internet for business for school and when I say affordable I mean it Americans pay too much for internet service be go to drive down the price for family who have service now and make it easy for family who do not have affordable service to be able to get it now as you see in Texas and elsewhere our electric and power power grid be vulnerable to storm catastrophic failure and security lapse with tragic result my American Jobs Plan will put hundred of thousand of people to work hundred of thousand of people to work line worker electrician and laborer lay thousand of mile of transmission line build a modern resilient and fully clean grid and cap hundred of thousand of literally orphan oil and gas well that need to be clean up because they re abandon pay the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dig that well in the first place well build upgrade and weatherize affordable energyefficient housing and commercial building for million of Americans even before the pandemic million of work family face enormous enormous financial and personal strain try to raise their kid and care for their parent at the same time the socalled sandwich generation or family member with disability you get a child at home you can not stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose you re go to put the child at risk or you lose your job or you have an elderly parent you re take care of and senior and people with disability live independently feel that strain as well but we know if they can remain independently live they live long the American Jobs Plan be go to help in big way its go to extend access to quality affordable home or communitybase care Think of expand vital service like program for senior or think of homecare worker go into home of senior and people with disability cooking meal help they get around their home and help they be able to live more independently for too long caregiver who be disproportionately woman and woman of color and immigrant have be unseen underpaid and undervalue this plan along with the American Families Plan change that with well wage benefit and opportunity for million of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that work for they you know decade ago the United States government use to spend 2 percent of its gdp its gross domestic product on research and development today we spend less than 1 percent I think its sevententh of 1 percent here why that matter be one of only a few major economy in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP have decline constantly over the last 25 year and we ve fall back the rest of the world be close in and close in fast we can not allow this to continue the American Jobs Plan be the big increase in our federal nondefense research and development spending on record its go to boost Americas innovative edge in market where global leadership be up for grab market like battery technology biotechnology computer chip clean energy the competition with China in particular critic say we should not spend this money they ask what do we get out of it well they say the same thing when we first fly into space for the first time they say the same thing well push the frontier lead to big benefit back home when NASA create Apollos digital flight control system unheard of at the time it lead to technology that help we today to drive our car and fly our plane when NASA invent way to keep food safe for the astronaut it lead to program that have be use to for decade to keep food safe in supermarket at least 2000 product and service have be develop and commercialize as a result of american space exploration GPS have help we find each other Computer chip allow we to see and talk to one another even when be separate by mountain and ocean singe Happy Birthday and watch the first step of that new baby grandchild comfort each other when comfort be need think about what it mean to you and your love one we just have to imagine again I have a long discussion with Xi Jinping the leader of China when he call to congratulate I we spend two hour on the phone and he say and be astonish by NASAs security team and the China expert who be on the line he say you ve always say Mr President that you can define America in one word possibility that s who we be in America anything be possible like what we do with vaccine a decade ago that lay the foundation for covid19 vaccine we have today like we do when the Interstate Highway System that transform the way we travel live work and developedamerican could visit relative anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon business here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix to this day about a quarter of all the mile Americans drive each year on one of those very original highway imagine what we can do what s within our reach when we modernize those highway you and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a highspeed train we can connect highspeed affordable reliable internet wherever you live Imagine know that you re hand your child and grandchild a country that will lead the world in produce clean energy technology and will need to address one of the big threat of our time that s what well do altogether along with the American Rescue Plan the proposal I put forward will create million of job estimate by some Wall Street outfit over 18 million job over four year goodpaying job it also work to level the playing field empower worker and ensure that the new job be good job that you can raise a family on and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively that s why my plan ask Congress to pass the protect the right to organize Act the PRO Act and send it to my desk this plan be important not only for what and how it build but its also important to where we build it include everyone regardless of your race or your zip Code too often economic growth and recovery be concentrate on the coast too often investment have fail to meet the need of marginalize community leave behind there be talent innovation everywhere and this plan connect that talent through city small town rural community through our business and our university through our entrepreneur union worker all across America we have to move now because I m convinced that if we act now in 50 year people be go to look back and say this be the moment that America win the future what I m propose be a onetime capital investment of roughly 2 trillion in Americas future spread largely over eight yearsIt will generate historic job growth historic economic growth help business to compete internationally create more revenue as well they be among the highestvalue investment we can make in the nation invest in our infrastructureBut put it another way fail to make these investment add to our debt and effectively put our child at a disadvantage relative to our competitor that s what crumble infrastructure do and our infrastructure be crumble be rank 13th in the world what s more it heighten our vulnerability to it attac attract our adversary to compete in way that they have not up to now and our adversary be worried about we build this critical infrastructure Put simply these be investment we have to make we can afford to make they or put another way we can not afford not to so how do we pay for it I speak to the Majority Leader and no long I guess he s no long the Majority Leader he have be for a long time I speak for the Republican I speak to the Republican Leader about the plan everybody be for do something on infrastructure why have not we do it well no one want to pay for it Less than four year ago as I say the Congress pass a tax cut of 2 trillion increase the national debt 2 trillion it do not meet virtually any of the prediction it would in term of grow the economy overwhelmingly the benefit of that tax package go to the wealthy Americans it even include new investment that would profit by shift profit and job overseas if you re a corporation it be bad for american competitiveness deeply unfair to the middleclass family and wrong for our futureSo here what I d do I start with one rule no one let I say it again no one make under 400000 will see their federal taxis go up Period this be not about penalize anyone I have nothing against millionaire and billionaire I believe american in american capitalism I want everyone to do well but here the deal right now a middleclass couple a firefighter and a teacher with two kid make a combine salary of say 110 120000 a year pay 22 cent for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax but a multinational corporation that build a factory abroad bring it home and then sell it they pay nothing at all be go to raise the corporate tax it be 35 percent which be too high we all agree five year ago it should go down to 28 percent but they reduce it to 21 percent be go to raise it back to up to 28 percent no one should be able to complain about that its still low than what that rate be between World War two and 2017 just do that one thing will generate 1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 yearsIn 2019 an independent analysis find that be 91 let I say it again 91 Fortune 500 company the big company in the world include Amazon they use various loophole so they d pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax I do not want to punish they but that s just wrong that s just wrong a fireman and a teacher pay 22 percent Amazon and 90 other major corporation be pay zero in federal taxesIm go to put an end to that and here how well do it be establish a global minimum tax for US corporation of 21 percent be go to level the international playing field that alone will raise 1 trillion over 15 year well also eliminate deduction by corporation for offshore job and shift asset overseas you do that you pay a penalty you do not get a reward in my plan and use the saving from that to give company tax credit to locate manufacturing here in manufacturing and production here in the United States and well significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporation who either fail to report their income or underreport its estimate that could raise hundred of billion of dollar all of this add up to more than what I ve propose to spend in just 15 yearsits honest its fiscally responsible and by the way as the expert will tell you it reduce the debt the federal debt over the long haulbut let I be clear these be my idea on how to pay for this plan if other have additional idea let they come forward I m open to other idea so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people make less than 400000 let I close with this Historically infrastructure have be a bipartisan undertaking many time lead by RepublicansIt be Abraham Lincoln who build the transcontinental railroad Dwight Eisenhower a Republican the Interstate Highway System I could go onand I do not think you ll find a Republican today in the House or Senate maybe I m wrong gentleman who do not think we have to improve our infrastructure they know China and other country be eat our lunch so there s no reason why it can not be bipartisan again the division of the moment should not stop we from do the right thing for the future I m go to bring Republicans into the Oval Office listen to they what they have to say and be open to other idea well have a goodfaith negotiation with any Republican who want to help get this do but we have to get it do I truly believe be in a moment where history be go to look back on this time as a fundamental choice that have to be make between democracy and autocracy you know there s a lot of autocrat in the world who think the reason why they re go to win be democracy can not reach consensus any long autocracy do that s what competition between America and China and the rest of the world be all about its a basic question can democracy still deliver for their people can they get a majority I believe we can I believe we must deliver for the american people be what the American Rescue Plan be all about and its be overwhelmingly popular when I write it everybody say I have no bipartisan support be overwhelm bipartisan support with republican register republican voter and ask around if you live in a town with a republican mayor a republican county executive or a republican governor ask they how many would rather get rid of the plan ask they if it help they at allits what the American Jobs Plan be about the new one I m propose I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort I hope and I believe a number of business will join this effort and I hope and believe the american people will join this effort Democrats republican and independent we can do this we have to do this we will do this we just have to remember this be the United States of America and I ve say it a thousand time there s nothing beyond our capacity if we act together so its time to move together thank you and I hope I get to come back to see you folk after this plan be pass and the question be you have to attract even more apprentice more people because be build so much God bless you all and may God protect our troop thank you applause
19 	 2021-03-25 	 the PRESIDENT please please sit down thank you thank you good afternoon before I take question I want to make give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 day into office here on vaccination and a few other top priority for the american peoplefirst on vaccination on December 8th I indicate that I hope to get 100 million shot in people arm in my first 100 day we meet that goal last week by day 58 42 day ahead of schedulenow today I m set a second goal and that be we will by my 100th day in office have administer 200 million shot in people arm that s right 200 million shot in 100 daysI know its ambitious twice our original goal but no other country in the world have even come close not even close to what we be do and I believe we can do itand today we ve make a historic investment in reach the hardesthit and the most vulnerable community the highestrisk community as a consequence of the virus by invest an addition 10 billion in be able to reach themI also set a goal before I take office of get a majority of school in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 day now thank to the enormous amount of work do by our administration educator parent local state education official and leader a recent Department of Education Department survey show that nearly half of the Kthrough8 school be open now full time five day a week for inperson learn not yet a majority but be really close and I believe in the 35 day leave to go well meet that goal as wella of yesterday more than 100 million payment of 1400 have go into people bank account that s real money in people pocket bring relief instantly almost and million more will be get their money very soonone final note since we pass the American Rescue Plan be start to see new sign of hope in our economy since it be pass a majority a majority of economic forecaster have significantly increase their projection on the economic growth that s go to take place this year they re now project it will exceed 6 percent a 6 percent growth in GDPAnd just this morning we learn that the number of people file for weekly unemployment insurance fall by nearly 100000 person that s the first time in a year the number have fall below the prepandemic highSo there be still too many Americans out of work too many family hurt and we still have a lot of work to dobut I can say to you the american people help be here and hope be on the waynow Ill be happy to take your questionszeke the Associated PressQ thank you Mr President you mention your progress on covid19 I d like to ask you about some of the other issue face your presidency one of the define challenge you face in the come month be how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issue like immigration reform gun control voting right climate change all of those right now be face stiff united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill how far be you willing to go to achieve those promise that you make to the american peoplethe PRESIDENT well I m go to look when I take office I decide that it be a fairly basic simple proposition and that be I get elect to solve problem and the most urgent problem face the american people I state from the outset be covid19 and the economic dislocation for million and million of Americans and so that s why I put all my focus in the beginning there be a lot of problem put all my focus on deal with those particular problemsand the other problem be talk about from immigration to gun and the other thing you mention be longterm problem they ve be around a long time and what be go to be able to do God willing be now begin one at a time to focus on those as well and whether its immigration or gun or a number of other problem that face the countrybut the fundamental problem be get people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wonder whether they lose their health insurance whether they re go to lose a family member whether they re go to be in a position where they re not go to be they re go to lose their home because they can not pay their mortgage or that million of people be go to get throw out of their home because of the inability to to pay their rentso be go to move on these one at a time try to do as many simultaneously as we can but that s the reason why I focus as I haveand here the deal I think my republican colleague be go to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed be to be to just decide to divide the country continue the politic of division but I m not go to do that I m just go to move forward and take these thing as they comeQ and just to to follow up Mr President can your presidency be a success if you can not make progress on those four challenge climate change immigration reform gun control voting rightsthe PRESIDENT well I plan on make progress on all of they but that s go to be for the american people to decideI think you know I doubt whether maybe you do maybe other do I think many of you think there be no possibility of my get the plan I get pass pass without any republican vote a pretty big deal it get pass grow the economy Peoples life be changingso let see what happen all I know I ve be hire to solve problem to solve problem not create divisionokay how about yamicheq thank so much Mr President you ve say over and over again that immigrant should not come to this country right now this be not the time to come that message be not be receive instead the perception of you that get you elect as a moral decent man be the reason why a lot of immigrant be come to this country and entrust you with unaccompanied minorshow do you resolve that tension and how be you choose which family can stay and which can go give the fact that even though with Title 42 there be some family that be stay and be there a timeline for when we will not be see these overcrowded facility with run by CPB sic when it come to unaccompanied minorsthe PRESIDENT well look I guess I should be flatter people be come because I m the nice guy that s the reason why its happen that I m a decent man or however its phrase that you know that s why they re come because they know Biden be a good guythe truth of the matter be nothing have change as many people come 28 percent increase in child to the border in my administration 31 percent in the last year of in 2019 before the pandemic in the Trump administration it happen every single solitary year there be a significant increase in the number of people come to the border in the winter month of January February March that happen every yearin addition to that there be a and nobody and by the way do anybody suggest that there be a 31 percent increase under Trump because he be a nice guy and he be do good thing at the border that s not the reason they re comingthe reason they re come be that its the time they can travel with the least likelihood of die on the way because of the heat in the desert number one number two they re come because of the circumstance incountry incountrythe way to deal with this problem and I start to deal with it back when I be a United States senator I mean Vice President put together a bipartisan plan of over 700 million to deal with the root cause of why people be leavingwhat do Trump do he eliminate that funding he do not use it he do not do it and in addition to that what he do he dismantle all the element that exist to deal with what have be a problem and and have be continue to be a problem for a long time he in fact shut down the the number of bed available he do not fund HHS to get people to get the child out of those those Border Patrol facility where they should not be and not suppose to be more than a few day a little while but he dismantle all of thatAnd so what be do now be attempt to rebuild rebuild the system that can accommodate the what be happen today and I like to think its because I m a nice guy but its not its because of what s happen every yearlet I say one other thing on this if you take a look at the number of people who be come the vast majority the overwhelming majority of people come to the border and crossing be be send back be be send back Thousands ten of thousand of people who be who be over 18 year of age and single people one at a time come have be send back send homewere send back the vast majority of the family that be come be try to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those family back but we that s what s happen they re not get across the borderAnd those who be come across the border who be unaccompanied child be move rapidly to try to put in place what be dismantle as I say for example of all the child who be come across the border over 70 percent be either 16 or 17 year old be not talk about people rip baby from mother arm or little threeyearold stand on the border Less than I think its one and a half percent fall in the category of the very youngso what be do be be provide for the space again to be able to get these kid out of the Border Patrol facility which no child no one should be in any long than 72 hoursand today I go to for example I use all the resource available to I go to the Defense Department and and the Secretary of Defense have just make available Fort Bliss 5000 bed be make easily available five thousand bed on the Texas borderSo be build back up the capacity that should have be maintain and build upon that Trump dismantle its go to take timeand the other thing be do I might add be I give you too long an answer because if you do not want the detail Q InaudibleTHE PRESIDENT no no but I mean I do not know how much detail you want about immigration maybe Ill stop there and fin Q my followup question be one if you could talk a little bit about which family why they re be allow to stay the family that be be allow to stay why they re be allow to stayand in addition to that when it come to the filibuster which be what Zeke be ask about there s immigration be a big issue of course when it relate to the filibuster but there s also Republicans who be pass bill after bill try to restrict voting right Chuck Schumer be call it an existential threat to democracy why not back a filibuster rule that at least get around issue include voting right or immigrationJim Clyburn someone who of course who you know very well have back the idea of a filibuster rule when it come to civil right and vote rightsTHE PRESIDENT well look I m go to deal with all of those problem the question be the priority as they come and land on my platelet go to the first question you ask the first of the second question you ask and that be what about deal with family why be not some not go back because Mexico be refuse to take they back they re say they will not take they back not all of themwere in negotiation with the President of Mexico I think be go to see that change they should all be go back all be go back the only people be not go to let sit there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help be childrenAnd what be do there and its an important point to understand I know you understand I do not mean to say it that way an important point to focus on the vast majority of people under the age of 18 come to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States a mother a father a close relative a grandmom or a grandpopwhat be happen before be it be take literally week and week and maybe even month before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really be someone there well we ve set up a system now where within 24 hour there s a phone call make as that person or that child cross the border and then a verification system be be put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that be a trafficker be call or that be actually a mom a dad andor a close relative they re establish that right off the batif it in fact be Mom or Dad Dad say to take the extreme case I get a birth certificate then guess what be get that kid directly to that parent immediatelyand so that s go to reduce significantly there s two way to reduce child population in circumstance that be not acceptable like be hold at a Border Patrol station one be to get they to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be hold the second way to do it be put they in a Health and Human Services facility that be occupy now both license bed around the country that exist as well as for example federal resource like Fort Bliss to get they safely in a place where they can be take care of while their fate be determinedQ and can you answer the filibuster inaudibleTHE PRESIDENT Filibuster Filibuster you know with regard to the filibuster I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that exist just when I come to the United States Senate 120 year ago and that be that it use to be require for the filibuster and I have a card on this I be go to give you the statistic but you probably know they that it use to be that that from between 1917 to 1971 the filibuster exist there be a total of 58 motion to break a filibuster that whole time last year alone there be five time that many so its be abuse in a gigantic wayAnd for example it use to be you have to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapse and guess what People get tired of talk and tired of collapse Filibusters break down and we be able to break the filibuster get a quorum and voteSo I strongly support move in that direction in addition to have an open mind about deal with certain thing that be be just elemental to the functioning of our democracy like the right to vote like the basic right to vote we ve amend the filibuster in the pastbut here the deal as you observe I m a fairly practical guy I want to get thing do I want to get they do consistent with what we promise the american people and in order to do that in a 5050 Senate we ve get to get to the place where I get 50 vote so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie or I get 51 vote without herand so I m go to say something outrageous I have never be particularly poor at calculate how to get thing do in the United States Senate so the good way to get something do if you if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to anyway I be go to get a lot do and if we have to if there s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster then well have to go beyond what I m talk aboutokay hang on sorry oh Seung Min Ms KimQ thank you Mr President to follow up on the filibuster so do you believe it should take 60 vote to end a filibuster on legislation or 51the PRESIDENT Laughs if we could end it with 51 we would have no problem you re go to have to the exist rule its go to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allow 50 vote to end the filibuster the existence of a filibusterbut its not my expertise in what the parliamentary rule and how to get there be but our preoccupation with the filibuster be totally legitimate but in the meantime we get a lot we can do while be talk about what be go to do about the filibusterlet I get here okay Cecilia Vega Q I d like to circle back to immigration please you just list the reason that people be come talk about incountry problem say that it happen every year you blame the last administration Sir I just get back last night from a report trip to the border where I meet nineyearold Yossell who walk here from Honduras by himself along with another little boy he have that phone number on he the PRESIDENT AstoundingQ and we be able to call his family his mother say that she send her son to this country because she believe that you be not deport unaccompanied minor like her son that s why she send he alone from HondurasSo sir you blame the last administration but be your messaging in say that these child be and will be allow to stay in this country and work their way through this process encourage family like Yossell say to comeTHE PRESIDENT well look the idea that I m go to say which I would never do if an unaccompanied child end up at the border be just go to let he starve to death and stay on the other side no previous administration do that either except Trump I m not go to do it I m not go to do itthat why I ve ask the Vice President of the United States yesterday to be the lead person on deal with focus on the fundamental reason why people leave Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador in the first place its because of earthquake flood its because of lack of food its because of gang violence its because of a whole range of thingsthat when I be Vice President and have the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied child I be able to get it slow up significantly by work with the head of state of those community to do thing like in one of the major city the reason people be leave be they could not walk in the street because they be get their kid be getting beat up or shoot or in gang violencewell what I be able to do be not give money to the head of state because so many be corrupt but I be able to say okay you need lighting in the street to change thing Ill put the lighting in we get a contractor we get the type of lighting we pay directly to the contractor it do not go through the government and violent crime significantly be reduce in that city few people seek to leavewhen this hurricane occur two hurricane instead of we go down and help in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they do not have housing or water or sustenance we do nothing be go to do a lot in our administration be go to be spend that 700plus million dollar a year to change the life and circumstance of why people leave in the first placethat mother do not sit around with on the kitchen table and say you know I get a great idea the way I m go to make sure my son get take care of be I m go to put a how old be he or sheq he s he s nine I also meet a 10yearoldthe PRESIDENT A nineyearold I m go to send he on a thousandmile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden be a nice guy and hell take care of himwhat a desperate act to have to take the circumstance must be horrible so we can do something about that that s what the Vice President be go to be do what I do when President Obama ask I to come and deal I be in I be in Turkey at the time and he say you get to come home and take care of this so we put together a plan and it have an impactand so the question here be whether how we go ahead and do this what we do there s no easy answerQ a quick follow if I may do you want to see these unaccompanied minor stay in this country or should they be deport eventuallythe PRESIDENT well the judgment have to be make whether or not and in this young man case he have a mom at home there s an overwhelming reason why he d be put in a plane and fly back to his momq final follow sir you mention circumstance that must be horrific the Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna Texas I be there be at 1556 percent capacity the PRESIDENT YepQ right now with mostly unaccompanied minor there be kid that be sleep on floor they be pack into these pod I ve speak to lawyer who say that they some of these child have not see the sun in day what s your reaction what be your reaction to these image that have come out from that particular facility be what s happen inside acceptable to you and when be this go to be fixedTHE PRESIDENT be that s a serious question rightis it acceptable to I come on that s why be go to be move a thousand of those kid out quickly that s why I get Fort Bliss open up that s why I ve be work from the moment this start to happen to try to find additional access for child to be able to safely not just child but particularly child to be able to safely be house while we follow through on the rest of what s happeningthat be totally unacceptableKenQ thank you Mr President I want to ask you about Afghanistan you face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of US troop from that country as a candidate in foreign affair you write that it be past time to end these forever war can you commit to the american people that by May 2nd the US will no long have force in AfghanistanTHE PRESIDENT the answer be that its go to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline just in term of tactical reason its hard to get those troop out so what we ve be do what I ve be do and what Secretary Blinken have be do have be we ve be meet with our ally those other nation that have NATO Allies who have troop in Afghanistan as well and if we leave be go to do so in a safe and orderly waywere in consultation I say with our ally and partner in how to proceed and Secretary Blinken be meet in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies

that s begin shortly on how to mechanically get people how to end this warbut it be not my intention to stay there for a long time but the question be how and in what circumstance do we meet that agreement that be make by President Trump to leave under a deal that look like its not be able to be work out to begin with how be that do but we be not stay a long timeQ you just say if we leave do you think its possible that weTHE PRESIDENT we will leave the question be when we leaveq do you sorry do you believe though its possible we could have troop there next yearTHE PRESIDENT I I can not picture that be the caseokay kristenq thank you very much Mr President give the condition that be just lay out at the migrant facility at the US border will you commit to allow journalist to have access to the facility that be overcrowded move forwardTHE PRESIDENT I will commit when my plan very shortly be underway to let you have access to not just they but to other facility as wellq how soon will journalist be able to have access to the facility we ve obviously be allow to be inside one but we have not see the facility in which child be pack together to really give the american people a chance to see that will you commit to transparency on this issue Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I will commit to transparency and as soon as I be in a position to be able to implement what we be do right nowand one of the reason I have not go down I have all my my chief folk have go down be I do not want to become the issue I do not want to be you know bring all of the Secret Service and everybody with I to get in the way so this be be set up and you ll have full access to everything once we get this thing movingQ okay and just to be clear how soon will that be Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I do not know to be clearq okay and do you bear responsibility for everything that s happen at the border now I hear you talk a lot about the past administration you decide to roll back some of those policy do you move too quickly to roll back inaudible policiesTHE PRESIDENT to roll back what I m sorryQ do you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive order of your predecessorthe PRESIDENT first of all all the policy that be underway be not help at all do not slow up the amount of immigration and there s many people comingand roll back the policy of separate child from from their mother I make no apology for that roll back the policy of Remain in Mexico sit on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and I make no apology for thati make no apology for end program that do not exist before Trump become President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law international law as well as on human dignity and so I make no apology for thatQ if I could just ask you about foreign policy Mr President Overnight we learn that North Korea test two ballistic missile what if any action will you take and what be your red line on North KoreaTHE PRESIDENT let I say that number one UN Resolution 1718 be violate by those particular missile that be test number one be consult with our ally and partner and there will be response if they choose to escalate we will respond accordinglybut I m also prepared for some form of diplomacy but it have to be condition upon the end result of denuclearization so that s what be do right now consult with our alliesQ just a very quick followup the PRESIDENT you ve only get another hour now okayQ Diplomacy can you define what you mean and former President Obama warn the incoming President Trump that North Korea be the top foreign policy issue that he be watch be that how you assess the crisis in North KoreaTHE PRESIDENT YesOkay Hang on a second here Kristen Nancy CBSQ thank you very much Mr President I want to go back to voting right and as Yamiche mention republican legislature across the country be work to pass bill that would restrict voting particularly Democrats fear impact minority voter and young voter the very people who help to get you elect in NovemberAre you worry that if you do not manage to pass voting right legislation that your party be go to lose seat and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022THE PRESIDENT what I m worried about be how unamerican this whole initiative be its sick its sick deciding in some state that you can not bring water to people stand in line wait to vote decide that you re go to end voting at five oclock when work people be just get off work decide that there will be no absentee ballot under the most rigid circumstancesits all design and I m go to spend my time do three thing one try to figure out how to pass the legislation pass by the House number one number two educate the american public the republican voter I know find this despicable republican voter the folk out in outside this White House I m not talk about the elect official I m talk about voter votersand so I be convinced that well be able to stop this because it be the most pernicious thing this make Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle I mean this be gigantic what they re try to do and it can not be sustainedIm go to do everything in my power along with my friend in the House and the Senate to keep that from from become the lawq be there anything else you can do about it besides pass legislationTHE PRESIDENT the answer be yes but I m not go to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you nowQ and then on a relate note have you decide whether you be go to run for reelection in 2024 you have not set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor have by this timeTHE PRESIDENT Laughs my predecessor need do sic need to my predecessor oh God I miss himq have you have you the PRESIDENT no the answer be yes my plan

ability to make computer chip and how we get ahead of the game how we can work together and be work together on a bunch of thingsbut look I know Mitch well Mitch know I well I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he say but this be a matter of make sure that I would like Republican elect republican support but what I know I have now be that I have electoral support from republican voter republican voter agree with what I m doingand so unless Mitch say the last thing I do be the last piece of legislation be so far leave well then he ought to a look at his party over 50 percent of they must be over that edge as well because they support what I didokay where be I here let I see KaitlanQ thank you very much Mr President I have a question for you but first I d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche and that s on the filibusterthe PRESIDENT that count as a question but go aheadQ okay Ill make it quick its a quick questionthe PRESIDENT no no you canq regard the filibuster at John Lewiss funeral President Barack Obama say he believe the filibuster be a relic of the Jim Crow era do you agreethe president YesQ and if not why not abolish it if its a relic of the Jim Crow eraTHE PRESIDENT Successful electoral politic be the art of the possible Lets figure out how we can get this do and move in the direction of significantly change the abuse of even the filibuster rule first its be abuse from the time it come into be by an extreme way in the last 20 year Lets deal with the abuse firstQ it sound like you re move close to eliminate the filibuster be that correctTHE PRESIDENT I answer your questionQ you also just make some news by say that you be go to run for reelectionTHE PRESIDENT I say that be my expectationq so be that a yes that you be run for reelectionTHE PRESIDENT Look I I do not know where you guy come from man I ve never be able to travel I m a great respecter of fate I ve never be able to plan four and half three and a half year ahead for certainQ and if you do the PRESIDENT it Q if you do run will Vice President Harris be on your ticketthe PRESIDENT I would fully expect that to be the case she s do a great job she s a great partner she s a great partnerQ and do you believe you ll be run against former President TrumpTHE PRESIDENT oh come on I do not even think about I do not I have no idea I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party do you I know you do not have to answer my question but I mean you know do youi mean look this be the way I view thing I ve become a great respecter of fate in my life I set a goal that s in front of I to get thing do for the people I care most about which be hardworke decent american people who be getting really have it stick to themi want to change the paradigm I want to change the paradigm we start to reward work not just wealth I want to change the paradigmif you notice do not you find it kind of interesting that my republican friend be worried about that the cost and the taxis that have to be have if there be any tax to be have as they talk about it in deal with the the act that we just pass which put money in people pocket ordinary peopledid you hear they complain when they pass close to a 2 trillion Trump tax cut 83 percent go to the top 1 percent do you hear they talk about that all I love the fact that they ve find this whole idea of concern about the federal budget its kind of amazingwhen the federal budget be save people live they do not think its such a good idea when the federal budget be feather the nest of the wealthy Americans 90 of the Fortune 500 company make billion of dollar not pay a cent in taxis reduce taxis to the point that people who be make you know if you re a husband and wife a schoolteacher and a cop you re pay at a high rate than the average person make a billion dollar a year be something be wrong their newfound concernim concerned look I mean what I say when I run and a lot of you still think I m wrong and I respect that I say I m run for three reason to restore the soul dignity honor honesty transparency to the american political system two to rebuild the backbone of this country the middle class hardworke people and people struggle to get in the middle class they build America and union build they the third reason I say I be run be to unite the country and generically speak all of you say no you can not do that well I ve not be able to unite the Congress but I ve be unite the country base on the polling datum we have to come together we have toso from my perspective you know its a to I its about just you know get out there put one foot in front of the other and just try to make thing well for people just hardworke people People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kid to be able have a little bit of breathing room be able to have make sure that they go to bed not stare at the ceiling like my dad wonder whether since he do not have health insurance what happen if mom get sick or he get sick these be basic thing Basic thingsand I m of the view that the vast majority of people include register Republicans by and large share that that same that same view that same sense of what be you know what s appropriatejustin Justin Sink BloombergQ thank Mr President I want to ask about your relationship with China now that you ve be in office for a couple month there s obviously the meeting in Alaska that be a little theatrical and there s the continue human right abusesSo today I m wonder be you more likely than you be when you come into office to maintain tariff on China be you consider ban import of forcedlabor product and would you consider cut off US investment or chinese access to international payment systemsthe PRESIDENT well look they re each specifically legitimate question but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really be aboutive know Xi Jinping for a long time allegedly by the time I leave office as Vice President I have spend more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader have because President Obama and the chinese President Hu decide we should get to know one another since it be inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country but it be obvious he be go to become the new leader of ChinaSo I spend hour upon hour with he alone with an interpreter my interpreter and his go into great detail he be very very straightforward do not have a democratic with a small d bone in his body but he s a smart smart guy he s one of the guy like Putin who think that autocracy be the wave of the future and democracy can not function in an ever an evercomplex worldSo when I be elect and he call to congratulate I I think to the surprise of the China expert who be his people be on call as well as mine listen we have a twohour conversation for two hoursand we make several thing clear to one another I make it clear to he again what I ve tell he in person on several occasion that be not look for confrontation although we know there will be steep steep competitiontwo that well have strong competition but well insist that China play by the international rule fair competition fair practice fair tradethirdly in order to compete effectively I indicate that be go to deal with China effectively and be go to need three thing to do that I tell he our people first be go to invest in american worker and american science I say that all through the campaign and I say it again and be and I m set up my administration to be able to do that which be that you know back in the 60 we use to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire gdp in pure research and investment in science Today its 07 percent I m go to change that be go to change thatThe future lie in who can in fact own the future as it relate to technology quantum compute a whole range of thing include in medical field and so what I m go to do be make sure we invest close to 2 percentone of the reason why I ve set up the the PAB pcast the Presidents board with scientist and the like again be be go to invest in medical research cancer Alzheimers diabete the thing industry of the future artificial intelligence quantum compute biotech and be go to make real investment China be out invest we by a longshot because their plan be to own that futureThe third the second thing be go to do be be go to reestablish our alliance and I ve be very clear with he its not antichinese and we ve talk about iti want to make sure that for example later today after this as a matter of fact shortly after this which be fine we ve be go close to an hour I m happy to go long but one of the thing that I m go to be do I m go to be speak with the 27 head of state in Europe and very shortly I think within the next hour or so I do not know the exact timeand early this month and apparently it get the Chineses attention that s not why I do it I meet with our ally and how be go to hold China accountable in the region Australia India Japan and the United States the socalled Quad because we have to have democracy work togetherbefore too long I m go to have I m go to invite an alliance of democracy to come here to discuss the future and so be go to make it clear that in order to deal with these thing we be go to hold China accountable to follow the rule to follow the rule whether it relate to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement make on Taiwan or a whole range of other thingsand the third thing and the thing that I admire about deal with Xi be he understand he make no pretense about not understand what I m say any more than I do he I point out to he no leader can be sustain in his position or her position unless they represent the value of the country and I say as and Mr President as I ve tell you before Americans value the notion of freedom America value human right we do not always live up to our expectation but its a value system we be found on that principle and as long as you and your country continue to so blatantly violate human right be go to continue in an unrelenting way to call to the attention of the world and make it clear make it clear what s happeningand he understand that I make it clear that no american President at least one do but no american President ever back down from speak out of what s happen to the uighur what s happen in Hong Kong what s happen incountrythat who we be the moment a President walk away from that as the last one do be the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world its who we areSo I see stiff competition with China China have an overall goal and I do not criticize they for the goal but they have an overall goal to become the lead country in the world the wealthy country in the world and the most powerful country in the world that s not go to happen on my watch because the United States be go to continue to grow and expandq all right just to follow up on the meeting of democracy be that where you expect in a multilateral way to make these decision about sanction or the PRESIDENT no that s not where I make the decision that s where I make sure be all on the same page all on the same page look I predict to you your child or grandchild be go to be do their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeed autocracy or democracy because that be what be at stake not just with ChinaLook around the world be in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence will there be middle class how will people adjust to these significant change in science and technology and the environment how will they do that and be democracy equip because all the people get to speak to competeIt be clear absolutely clear and most of the scholar I deal with at Penn agree with I around the country that this be a battle between the utility of democracy in the 21st century and autocraciesif you notice you do not have Russia talk about communism anymore its about an autocracy demand decision make by a leader of a country that s what s at stake here we ve get to prove democracy worksQ and Mr President sorry I know you have not have a chance to address the tragedy in Georgia and Colorado you have say to stay tune for action that you might take on gun control wonder if you ve make a decision either about send the manufacturer liability bill that you have promise on day one to Capitol Hill or executive action like go after ghost gun or give money to city and state to battle gun controlthe PRESIDENT all the above its a matter of timingas you ve all observe successful president well than I have be successful in large part because they know how to time what they re do order it decide and prioritize what need to be donethe next major initiative be and Ill be announce it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail be to rebuild the infrastructure both physical and technological infrastructure in this country so that we can compete and create significant number of really goodpaye job really goodpaye jobsand some of you have be around long enough to know that use to be a great republican goal and initiative I still think the majority of the american people do not like the fact that we be now rank what 85th in the world in infrastructureI mean look the future rest on whether or not we have the good airport that be go to accommodate air travel port that you can get in and out of quickly so business decidesome of you if you be ever local reporter and you find your governor or mayor try to attract business to your community what s the first thing that business ask what s the close access to access to an interstate highway how far be I from a freight rail be the water be the water available be there enough water available for I to conduct my business all the thing that relate to infrastructureWe have somewhere I ask the staff to write it down for I and they do not for this but for a long discussion we have somewhere in term of infrastructure we have we rank 13th globally in infrastructure China be invest three time more in infrastructure than the United States isbridge More than one third of our bridge 231000 of they need repair some be physical safety risk or preservation work one in five mile of our highway and major road be in poor condition that s 186000 mile of highway Aviation 20 percent of all flight 20 percent of all flight be not on time result in 15 million hour lose in production six to ten million home in America still have lead pipe service their water line we have over 100000 wellhead that be not cap leak methanewhat be we do and by the way we can put as many pipefitter and miner and to work cap those well at the same price that they would charge to dig those wellsSo I I just find it frustrate frustrating to talk aboutlast point Ill make on the infrastructure and I apologize for spend more time on it but be that if you think about it its the place where we will be able to significantly increase american productivity at the same time provide really good job for people but we can not build back to what they use to be we have to build the environment have global warming have already do significant damagethe road that use to be above the water level do not have to worry about where the drainage ditch be now you get to rebuild they three foot high because its not go to go back to what it be before it will only get bad unless we stop itthere so much we can do look at all of the school in America Most of you live in the Washington area now but in your hometown I do not know where you re all from how many school where the kid can not drink the water out of the fountain how many school be still in the position where there s asbestos how many school in America be send our kid to do not have adequate ventilation how many home building office complex be waste billion of barrel of oil over time because they can not hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leak through the window that be so porous and the connection its amazingSo there s so much we can do that s good stuff make people healthy and create good jobsand I think that I get one more question here Janet from UnivisionQ thank you Mr President we too have be report at the border and just like Cecilia we run into a pair of sibling who come in on Monday who be detain by CBP have the phone number for their mother who live in the US we have contact the mother that s the only way they know her kid be here because CBP today Thursday have not contact that mother so when can we expect your promise of thing get well with contacting and expediency and processingthe PRESIDENT well they re already get well but they re go to get real they ll get a whole hell of lot well real quick or be go to hear of some people leave okayWe can get this do be go to get it doneI have a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinetlevel officer the other night be go to be move within the next within the next week over 100000 I mean 1000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe secure bed and facility be go to significantly ramp up be already out there contact everyone from get some of the employee at HHS and there s a lot of they do other thing and move they into make those call be in a be in the process of rearrange and provide for the personnel need to get that donebut I admire the fact that you be down there you re make the call yourself its realThe next thing that have to happen though as you well know have to happen there have to be some certitude that this be the actually mom dad or whomever and there s way to do that there s way to do that a little bit like determine whether or not you get the right code for your credit card you know what be your dog name kind of a thing I m be a bit facetious but not really and also seek hard datum from DNA to to birth certificate which take long so I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possibleQ as you well know treat the root cau cause in Latin America do not change thing overnight how do you realistically and physically keep these family from come to the US when thing will not get well in their country right awaythe PRESIDENT well I can not guarantee that but I know you know that old thing the journey of 1000 mile start with the first stepyou know as well as I do you cover it you have serious its not like somebody at a sit handhewn table in Guatemala I mean in in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe say I get a great idea Lets sell everything we have give it to a coyote have he take our kid across the border and into a desert where they do not speak the language will not that be fun Lets go that s not how it happen People do not want to leavewhen my great grandfather get on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea expectation be be he go to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America but they leave because of what the Brits have be do they be in real real trouble they do not want to leave but they have no choice so you get we can not I can not guarantee be go to solve everything but I can guarantee we can make everything well we can make it well we can change the life of so many peopleand the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out I realize its much more heart wrench and it be to deal with a five and six and sevenyearold but you go down there and you see the vast majority of these child 70 percent be 16 year old 17 year old and mostly male do not make it that do not make it good bad or indifferent but the idea that we have ten of thousand of kid in these godawful facility that be really little baby cry all night and there s some that s true that s why we get to actAnd yesterday I ask my team both the director of the two agency as well as other I ask they what would they in fact and I ask their opinion because they re the expert but I say Focus on the most vulnerable immediatelybut there s no reason why in the next month as people cross the border that phone call can not be make in the first 48 hour and beginQ if I may ask one last question have you have any talk with Senate Republicans who be threaten this administration with not consider the immigration legislation that be pass in the House until the situation at the border have be resolvedthe PRESIDENT no because I know they have to posture for a while they sort of get to get it out of their system this be a but I m ready to work with any Republican who want to help solve the problem and make the situation betterBut folk I m go thank you very very much I appreciate it thank you
20 	 2021-03-11 	 the PRESIDENT Good evening my fellow AmericansTonight I d like to talk to you about where we be as we mark one year since everything stop because of this pandemica year ago we be hit with a virus that be meet with silence and spread uncheckeddenial for day week then month that lead to more death more infection more stress and more lonelinessphoto and video from 2019 feel like they be take in another era the last vacation the last birthday with friend the last holiday with the extended familywhile it be different for everyone we all lose somethingA collective suffer a collective sacrifice a year fill with the loss of life and the loss of live for all of usbut in the loss we see how much there be to gain in appreciation respect and gratitudefinde light in the darkness be a very american thing to do in fact it may be the most american thing we doAnd that s what we ve doneweve see frontline and essential worker risk their life sometimes lose they to save and help other Researchers and scientist race for a vaccine and so many of you as Hemingway write be strong in all the broken placesI know its be hard I truly knowAs I ve tell you before I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have die from covid to date its on the back of my schedule as of now the total death in America 527726 that s more death than in World War One World War two the Vietnam War and 911 combinedthey be husband wife son and daughter grandparent friend neighbor young and old they leave behind love one unable to truly grieve or to heal even to have a funeralbut I m also think about everyone else who lose this past year to natural cause by cruel fate of accident or other disease they too die alone they too leave love one behind who be hurt badlyyou know you ve often hear I say before I talk about the long walk any parent can make be up a short flight of stair to his child bedroom to say I m sorry I lose my job we can not be here anymore like my Dad tell I when he lose his job in ScrantonSo many of you have have to make that same walk this past yearyou lose your job you close your business face eviction homelessness hunger a loss of control and maybe bad of all a loss of hopewatche a generation of child who may be set back up to a year or more because they ve not be in school because of their loss of learningIts the detail of life that matter most and we ve miss those detailsthe big detail and small momentswedding birthday graduation all the thing that need to happen but do not the first date the family reunion the Sunday night ritualsits all have exact a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of we for we be fundamentally a people who want to be with other to talk to laugh to hug to hold one anotherbut this virus have keep we apartgrandparent have not see their child or grandchild Parents have not see their kid kid have not see their friendsthe thing we use to do that always fill we with joy have become the thing we could not do and break our heartsToo often we ve turn against one anotherA mask the easy thing to do to save life sometimes it divide usStates pit against one other instead of work with each othervicious hate crime against asian Americans who have be attack harass blame and scapegoate at this very moment so many of they our fellow Americans they re on the frontline of this pandemic try to save life and still still they be force to live in fear for their life just walk down street in America its wrong its unamerican and it must stoplook we know what we need to do to beat this virus tell the truth follow the scientist and the science Work together put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function which be protect the american people no function more importantwe need to remember the government be not some foreign force in a distant capital no its us all of we we the People for you and I that America thrive when we give our heart when we turn our hand to common purpose and right now my friend we be do just that and I have to say as your President I be grateful to youlast summer I be in Philadelphia and I meet a smallbusiness owner a woman I ask she I say what do you need most Ill never forget what she say to I she say look I in the eye she say I just want the truth the truth just tell I the truth think of thatMy fellow Americans you re owe nothing less than the truthAnd for all of you ask when thing will get back to normal here be the truth the only way to get our life back to get our economy back on track be to beat the virusyouve be hear I say that for while I be run and the last 50 day I ve be President but this be one of the most complex operation we ve under ever undertake as a nation in a long timethat why I m use every power I have as President of the United States to put we on a war foot to get the job do it sound like hyperbole but I mean it a war footingand thank God be make some real progress nowOn my first full day in office I outline for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic and we have spend every day since attempt to carry it outtwo month ago the country this country do not have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the american public but soon we willweve been work with the vaccine manufacturer Pfizer Moderna Johnson Johnson to manufacture and purchase hundred of million of dose of these three safe effective vaccine and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration Johnson Johnson be work together with a competitor Merck to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson Johnson vaccine which be one shotIn fact just yesterday I announce and I meet with the ceo of both company I announce our plan to buy an additional 100 million dose of Johnson Johnson vaccine these two company competitor have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applaud for itits truly a national effort just like we see during World War IINow because of all the work we ve do well have enough vaccine supply for all adult in America by the end of May that s month ahead of scheduleAnd be mobilize thousand of vaccinator to put the vaccine in one arm call on active duty military FEMA retire doctor and nurse administrator and those to administer the shotsand we ve be create more place to get the shot we ve make it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one any one of nearly 10000 pharmacy across the country just like you get your flu shotwere also work with governor and mayor in red state and blue state to set up and support nearly 600 federally support vaccination center that administer hundred of thousand of shot per day you can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot get your shot never leave your car and drive home in less than an hourweve be send vaccine to hundred of community health center all across America locate in underserved area and we ve be deploy and we will deploy more mobile vehicle and popup clinic to meet you where you live so those who be least able to get the vaccine be able to get itwe continue to work on make athome testing availableand we ve be focus on serve people in the hardesthit community of this pandemic Black Latino Native American and rural communitiesSo what do all this add up to when I take office 50 day ago only 8 percent of Americans after month only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 have get their first vaccination today that number be nearly 65 percent just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75 50 day ago have get their first shot today that number be well over 70 percentwith new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the CDC that come out on Monday it mean simply this million and million of grandparent who go month without be able to hug their grandkid can now do so and the more people who be fully vaccinate the CD CDC will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace place of worship with friend and as well as travelwhen I come into office you may recall I set a goal that many of you say be kind of way over the top I say I intend to get 100 million shot in people arm in my first 100 day in office tonight I can say we be not only go to meet that goal be go to beat that goal because be actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shot in arm on my 60th day in office no other country in the world have do this NoneNow I want to talk about the next step be think aboutfirst tonight I m announce that I will direct all state tribe and territory to make all adult people 18 and over eligible to be vaccinate no later than May 1Let I say that again all adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1 that s much early than expectedlet I be clear that do not mean everyone go to have that shot immediately but it mean you ll be able to get in line begin May 1 every adult will be eligible to get their shotTo do this be go to go from a million shot a day that I promise in December before I be swear in to maintain beat our current pace of two million shot a day outpace the rest of the worldsecondly at the time when every adult be eligible in May we will launch with our partner new tool to make it easy for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot include a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinate and the one near you no more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your love onesthirdly with the passage of the American Rescue Plan and I thank again the House and Senate for pass it and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teacher and school staff include bus driver we can accelerate the massive nationwide effort to reopen our school safely and meet my goal that I state at the same time about 100 million shot of open the majority of k8 school in my first 100 day in office this be go to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education Miguel CardonaFourth in the come week we will issue further guidance on what you can and can not do once fully vaccinate to lessen the confusion to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinatedand finally fifth and maybe most importantly I promise I will do everything in my power I will not relent until we beat this virus but I need you the american people I need you I need every American to do their part and that s not hyperbole I need youi need you to get vaccinate when its your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friend and neighbor get vaccinate as wellbecause here the point if we do all this if we do our part if we do this together by July the 4th there s a good chance you your family and friend will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day that do not mean large event with lot of people together but it do mean small group will be able to get togetherafter this long hard year that will make this Independence Day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virusBut to get there we can not let our guard downthis fight be far from order from over as I tell the woman in Pennsylvania I will tell you the truthA July 4th with your love one be the goal but a goal a lot can happen condition can changethe scientist have make clear that thing may get bad again as new variant of the virus spreadAnd we ve get work to do to ensure everyone have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccinesSo my message to you be this listen to Dr Fauci one of the most distinguished and trust voice in the world he have assure we the vaccine be safe they undergo rigorous scientific review I know they re safe Vice President Harris and I know they re safe that s why we get the vaccine publicly in front of camera so for the world to see so you could see we do it the First Lady and the Second Gentleman also get vaccinatedtalk to your family your friend your neighbor the people you know good who ve get the vaccineWe need everyone to get vaccinate we need everyone to keep wash their hand stay socially distanced and keep wear the mask as recommend by the cdcbecause even if we devote every resource we have beat this virus and get back to normal depend on national unityAnd national unity be not just how politic and politician vote in Washington or what the loud voice say on cable or online Unity be what we do together as fellow Americans because if we do not stay vigilant and the condition change then we may have to reinstate restriction to get back on track and please we do not want to do againweve make so much progress this be not the time to let up just as we be emerge from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer be not the time to not stick with the rulesIll close with thisweve lose so much over the last yearweve lose family and friendsweve lose business and dream we spend year buildingweve lose time time with each otherAnd our child have lose so much time with their friend time with their school no graduation ceremony this this spring no graduation from college high school movingup ceremoniesyou know and there s something else we lostwe lose faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard thing for the American peopleBut as I stand here tonight be prove once again something I have say time and time again until they re probably tired of hear I say it I say it foreign leader and domestic alike its never ever a good bet to bet against the american people America be come backThe development manufacture and distribution of the vaccine in record time be a true miracle of science it be one of the most extraordinary achievement any country have ever accomplishedand we also just see the Perseverance rover land on Mars stunning image of our dream that be now a reality another example of the extraordinary american ingenuity commitment and belief in science and one anotherand today I sign into law the American Rescue Plan an historic piece of legislation that deliver immediate relief to million of people it include 1400 in direct rescue check payment that mean a typical family of four earn about 110000 will get check for 5600 deposit if they have direct deposit or in a check a Treasury checkit extend unemployment benefit it help small business it lower healthcare premium for many it provide food and nutrition keep family in their home and it will cut child poverty in this country in half accord to the expert and it fi and it fund all the step I ve just describe to beat the virus and create million of jobsIn the come week and month Ill be travel along with the First Lady the Vice President the Second Gentleman and member of my Cabinet to speak directly to you to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meet the moment and if it fail at any pa I will acknowledge that it fail but it will notabout how after a long dark year one whole year there be hope and light of well day aheadIf we all do our part this country will be vaccinate soon our economy

we be about to go through but now be come through it and its a share experience that bind we together as a nation we be bind together by the loss and the pain of the day that have go by but be also bind together by the hope and the possibility of the day in front of usMy fervent prayer for our country be that after all we have be through well come together as one people one nation one AmericaI
