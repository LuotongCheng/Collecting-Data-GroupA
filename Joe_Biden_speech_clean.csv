As Ukraine fights Russia and Israel fights the terrorist organization Hamas, the United States must continue to show up for its allies. President Biden announces that he is sending an urgent budget request to Congress to fund America's national security needs, supporting ""our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.""",Good evening my fellow Americans Were facing an inflection point in historyone of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come Thats what Id like to talk with you about tonightYou know earlier this morning I returned from Israel They tell me Im the first American president to travel there during a warI met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet And most movingly I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of OctoberMore than 1300 people slaughtered in Israel including at least 32 American citizens Scores of innocentsfrom infants to elderly grandparents Israelis Americanstaken hostageAs I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas were pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home As President there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostageThe terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world But sadly the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on othersIn Israel I saw a people who are strong determined resilient and also angry in shock and in deep deep painI also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian peoples right to dignity and to selfdetermination The actions of Hamas terrorists dont take that right awayLike so many other I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life including the explosion at a hospital in Gazawhich was not done by the IsraelisWe mourn every innocent life lost We cant ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunityYou know the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war tragedy and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukrainepeople that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his allout invasionWeve have not forgotten the mass graves the bodies found bearing signs of torture rape used as a weapon by the Russians and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia stolen from their parents Its sickHamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracycompletely annihilate itHamasits stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish peopleHamas does not represent the Palestinian people Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of themMeanwhile Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine And just two weeks ago he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdrawand if the United States withdraw our allies will as wellmilitary support for Ukraine it would have quote a week left to live But were not withdrawingI know these conflicts can seem far away And its natural to ask Why does this matter to AmericaSo let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for Americas national security You know history has taught us that when terrorists dont pay a price for their terror when dictators dont pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction They keep going and the cost and the threats to America and to the world keep risingSo if we dont stop Putins appetite for power and control in Ukraine he wont limit himself just to Ukraine HesPutin has already threated to remindquote remind Poland that their western land was a gift from RussiaOne of his top advisors a former president of Russia has called Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Russias Baltic provinces These are all NATO AlliesFor 75 years NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security And if Putin attacks a NATO Ally we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls forWe will have something that we do not seekmake it clear we do not seekwe do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against RussiaBeyond Europe we know that our allies and maybe most importantly our adversaries and competitors are watching Theyre watching our response in Ukraine as wellAnd if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraines independence wouldbe aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the worldin the IndoPacific in the Middle Eastespecially in the Middle EastIran isis supporting Russia in Ukraine and its supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region And well continue to hold them accountable I might addThe United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East one where the Middle East is more stable better connected to its neighbors andthrough innovative projects like the IndiaMiddle EastEurope rail corridor that I announced this year at the summit of the worlds biggest economies More predictable markets more employment less rage less grievances less war when connected It benefits the peopleit would benefit the people of the Middle East and it would benefit usAmerican leadership is what holds the world together American alliances are what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel its just not worth itThats why tomorrow Im going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund Americas national security needs to support our critical partners including Israel and UkraineIts a smart investment thats going to pay dividends for American security for generations help us keep American troops out of harms way help us build a world that is safer more peaceful and more prosperous for our children and grandchildrenIn Israel we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and alwaysThe security package Im sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israels security that will sharpen Israels qualitative military edge which weve committed tothe qualitative military edgeWere going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel Were going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreadingLook at the same time Prime Minister Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can The people of Gaza urgently need food water and medicineYesterday in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in GazaIf Hamas does not divert or steal this shipmentthese shipments were going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the PalestiniansAnd as I said in Israel As hard as it is we cannot give up on peace We cannot give up on a twostate solutionIsrael and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and peaceYou know and here at home we have to be honest with ourselves In recent years too much hate has been given too much oxygen fueling racism a rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia right here in AmericaIts also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our heartsOn October 7th terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish communityToday Jewish families worried about being targeted in school wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street or going out about their daily livesYou know I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community the Palestinian American community and so many others are outraged and hurting saying to yourselves Here we go again with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 911Just last week a mother was brutally stabbed a little boyhere in the United Statesa little boy who had just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of ChicagoHis name was WadeaWadeaa proud American a proud Palestinian American familyWe cant stand by and stand silent when this happens We must without equivocation denounce antisemitism We must also without equivocation denounce IslamophobiaAnd to all of you hurtingthose of you who are hurting I want you to know I see you You belong And I want to say this to you Youre all America Youre all AmericaThis is in a moment where theresyou know in moments like these when fear and suspicion anger and rage run hard that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we areWere a nation of religious freedom freedom of expression We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or in our communitiesAnd we must renounce violence and vitriol see each other not as enemies but asbut as fellow AmericansWhen I was in Israel yesterday I said that when America experienced the hell of 911 we felt enraged as well While we sought and got justice we made mistakes So I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rageAnd here in America let us not forget who we are We reject all formsall forms of hate whether against Muslims Jews or anyone Thats what great nations do and we are great nationOn Ukraine Im asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putins brutality in UkraineThey are succeedingWhen Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he would take Kyiv and all of Ukraine in a matter of days Well over a year later Putin has failed and he continues to fail Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian peopleUkraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory that Russian troops once occupied backed by a USled coalition of more than 50 countries around the world all doing its part to support KyivWhat would happen if we walked away We are the essential nationMeanwhile Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and peopleFrom the outset I have said I will not send American troops to fight in UkraineAll Ukraine is asking for is helpfor the weapons munitions the capacity the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian citiesAnd let me be clear about something We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles And when we use the money allocated by Congress we use it to replenish our own storesour own stockpiles with new equipmentequipment that defends America and is made in America Patriot missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona artillery shells manufactured in 12 states across the countryin Pennsylvania Ohio Texas and so much moreYou know just as in World War Two today patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedomLet me close with this Earlier this year I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland There I boarded a train with blackedout windows for a 10hour ride each way to Kyiv to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the oneyear anniversary of their brave fight against PutinIm told I was the first American president to enter a warzone not controlled by the United States military since President LincolnWith me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisorsBut when I exited that train and met ZelenskyyPresident Zelenskyy I didnt feel alone I was bringing with me the idea of America the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago freedom independence selfdeterminationAnd as I walked through Kyiv with President Zelenskyy with air raid sirens sounding in the distance I felt something Ive always believed more strongly than ever before America is a beacon to the world still StillWe are as my friend Madeleine Albright said the indispensable nationTonight there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us who believe in a better life because of us who are desperate not be forgotten by us and who are waiting for usBut time is of the essenceI know we have our divisions at home We have to get past them We cant let petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nationWe cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win I refuse to let that happenIn moments like these we have to remind we have to remember who we are We are the United States of Americathe United States of America And there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it togetherMy fellow Americans thank you for your timeMay God bless you all And may God protect our troops

He stresses the US and European commitment to defending Ukraine and standing up for freedom and democracy around the world.",THE PRESIDENT Hello Poland One of our great allies President Duda Prime Minister Mr Prime Minister Mr Mayor and to all the former ministers and presidents as well as mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country Thank you for welcoming me back to PolandYou know it was nearly one year ago nearly one year ago I spoke at the Royal Castle here in Warsaw just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine The largest land war in Europe since World War Two had begun And the principles that had been the cornerstone of peace prosperity and stability on this planet for more than 75 years were at risk of being shatteredOne year ago the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv Well I have just come from a visit to Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong Kyiv stands proud It stands tall And most important it stands freeWhen Russia invaded it wasnt just Ukraine being tested The whole world faced a test for the agesEurope was being tested America was being tested NATO was being tested All democracies were being tested And the questions we faced were as simple as they were profoundWould we respond or would we look the other way Would we be strong or would we be weak Would be we would would we be all of our allies would be united or dividedOne year later we know the answer We did respond We would be strong We would be united And the world would not look the other way We also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principles Would we stand up for the sovereignty of nations Would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression Would we stand up for democracyOne year later we know the answers Yes we would stand up for sovereignty And we did Yes we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression And we did And we would stand up for democracy And we didAnd yesterday I had the honor to stand with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things no matter whatWhen President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine he thought we would roll over He was wrongThe Ukrainian people are too braveAmerica Europe a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific we were too unifiedDemocracy was too strongInstead of an easy victory he perceived and predicted Putin left with burntout tanks and Russias forces in delay in disarray He thought hed get the Finlandization of NATO Instead he got the NATOization of Finland and Sweden He thought NATO would fracture and divide Instead NATO is more united and more unified than ever than ever beforeHe thought he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve Europes resolveInstead were working together to end Europes dependence on Russian fossil fuels He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were softAnd then he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and forceHe found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel President Zelenskyy President Putin President Putin is confronted with something today that he didnt think was possible a year ago The democracies of the world have grown stronger not weaker But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker not strongerBecause in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty that knowing what you stand for is most important and knowing who stands with you makes all the differenceThe people of Poland know that You know that In fact you know you know it better than anyone here in Poland Because thats what solidarity meansThrough partition and oppression when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw Uprising during decades under the iron fist of communist rule Poland endured because you stood togetherThats how the brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracyThats how the resolve of Moldovan people applause resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membershipPresident Sandu is here today Im not sure where she is But Im proud to stand with you and the freedomloving people of Moldova Give her a round of applauseOne year into this war Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition But he still doubts our conviction He doubts our staying power He doubts our continued support for Ukraine He doubts whether NATO can remain unifiedBut there should be no doubt Our support for Ukraine will not waver NATO will not be divided and we will not tire President Putins craven lust for land and power will fail And the Ukrainian peoples love for their country will prevailDemocracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today tomorrow and forever For thats what thats whats at stake here freedomThats the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday directly to the people of UkraineWhen President Zelenskyy said he came to the United States in December quote he said this struggle will define the world and what our children and grandchildren how they live and then their children and grandchildrenHe wasnt only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine He was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren Yours and mineWere seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people all across Europe saw for decades Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased They must be opposedAutocrats only understand one word No No No No you will not take my country No you will not take my freedom No you will not take my futureAnd Ill repeat tonight what I said last year in this same place A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the peoples love of liberty Brutality will never grind down the will of the free And Ukraine Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia Never For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darknessYou know this has been an extraordinary year in every senseExtraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries They have committed depravities crimes against humanity without shame or compunction Theyve targeted civilians with death and destruction Used rape as a weapon of war Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to in an attempt to steal Ukraines future Bombed train stations maternity hospitals schools and orphanagesNo one no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people Its abhorrent Its abhorrentBut extraordinarily as well has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the worldOne year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine Ukraine is still independent and freeFrom Kherson to Kharkiv Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their landIn more than 50 percent of the territory Russia held last year the blue and the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once againPresident Zelenskyy still leads a democratically elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian peopleAnd the world has already voted multiple times including in the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russias aggression and support a just peaceEach time in the UN that vote has been overwhelmingIn October 143 nations in the United Nations condemned Russias illegal annexation Only four four in the entire UN voted with Russia FourSo tonight I speak once more to the people of RussiaThe United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia The West was not plotting to attack Russia as Putin said today And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemyThis war was never a necessity its a tragedy President Putin chose this war Every day the war continues is his choice He could end the war with a wordIts simple If Russia stopped invading Ukraine it would end the war If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia it would be the end of UkraineThats why together were making sure Ukraine can defend itselfThe United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines Air defense systems artillery ammunition tanks and armored vehiclesThe European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine not just in security assistance but economic and humanitarian refugee assistance and so much more To all of you here tonight Take a moment And Im serious when I say this Turn on and look turn around and look at one another Look at what youve done so farPoland is hosting more than 15 million refugees from this war God bless you Polands generosity your willingness to open your hearts and your homes is extraordinaryAnd the American people are united in our resolve as wellAll across my country in big cities and small towns Ukrainian flags fly from American homes Over the past year Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedomThats who Americans are and thats what Americans do The world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putins warPutin tried to starve the world blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hardInstead the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answered the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food suppliesAnd this week my wife Jill Biden is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issueOur commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine a Ukraine thats free sovereign and democraticThat was the dream of those who declared Ukraines independence more than 30 years ago who led the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity who braved ice and fire on the Maidan and the Heavenly Hundred who died there and those who continue still to root out Kremlins efforts to corrupt coerce and controlIts a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who have fought for years against Russias aggressions in the Donbas and the heroes who have given everything given their lives in the service of their beloved UkraineI was honored to visit their memorial in Kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives standing alongside President ZelenskyyThe United States and our partners stand with Ukraines teachers its hospital staff its emergency responders the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russias cruel bombardmentWe stand with the millions of refugees of this war who have found a welcome in Europe and the United States particularly here in PolandOrdinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so Polish businesses civil society cultural leaders including the First Lady of Poland who is here tonight have led with the heart and determination showcasing all thats good about the human spiritMadam First Lady we love you Thank you all Ill never forget last year visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw seeing their faces exhausted and afraid holding their children so close worrying they might never see their fathers their husbands their brothers or sisters againIn that darkest moment of their lives you the people of Poland offered them safety and light You embraced them You literally embraced them I watched I watched the looks on their faces Meanwhile together we have made sure that Russia is paying the price for its abusesWe continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country in history And were going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partnersWell hold accountable those who are responsible for this war And we will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the RussiansYou know there is much for us to be proud of over the all that we have achieved together this past year But we have to be honest and clearedeyed as we look at the year aheadThe defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year Its always difficult Its always importantAs Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counteroffensives of its own there will continue to be hard and very bitter days victories and tragedies But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead And the United States together with our Allies and partners are going to continue to have Ukraines back as it defends itselfNext year I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States Together well celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world NATO And let there be no doubt the commitment of the United States to our NATO Alliance and Article 5 is rock solid And every member of NATO knows it And Russia knows it as wellAn attack against one is an attack against all Its a sacred oath A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territoryOver the past year the United States has come together with our Allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggressionBut the work in front of us is not just what were against its about what were for What kind of world do we want to buildWe need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up lifting up the lives of people everywhere improving health growing prosperity preserving the planet building peace and security treating everyone with dignity and respectThats our responsibility The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our peopleAs we gather tonight the world in my view is at an at an inflection point The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to comeThats true for Americans Its true for the people of the worldAnd while decisions are ours to make now the principles and the stakes are eternal A choice between chaos and stability Between building and destroying Between hope and fear Between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it Between nothing less than limitation and possibilities the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom FreedomFreedom There is no sweeter word than freedom There is no nobler goal than freedom There is no higher aspiration than freedomAmericans know that and you know it And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as wellFreedomThe enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the agesFreedomStand with us We will stand

He talks about ""finishing the job"" on many of the efforts he began during his administration, such as lowering prices on prescription drugs, giving access to health care to more Americans, tackling climate change, and making the tax system fair. He also urges Congress to ban assault weapons, raise the debt ceiling, and stop the surge of fentanyl in America. He ends his speech, noting that ""I have never been more optimistic about the future of America.""",Mr Speaker Madam Vice President Our First Lady and Second GentlemanMembers of Congress and the Cabinet Leaders of our militaryMr Chief Justice Associate Justices and retired Justices of the Supreme CourtAnd you my fellow AmericansI start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthyMr Speaker I look forward to working togetherI also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history Hakeem JeffriesCongratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history Mitch McConnellAnd congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader this time with an even bigger majorityAnd I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country Nancy PelosiThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience Of always moving forward Of never giving upA story that is unique among all nationsWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered itThat is what we are doing againTwo years ago our economy was reelingAs I stand here tonight we have created a record 12 million new jobs more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four yearsTwo years ago COVID had shut down our businesses closed our schools and robbed us of so muchToday COVID no longer controls our livesAnd two years ago our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil WarToday though bruised our democracy remains unbowed and unbrokenAs we gather here tonight we are writing the next chapter in the great American story a story of progress and resilience When world leaders ask me to define America I define our country in one word PossibilitiesYou know were often told that Democrats and Republicans cant work togetherBut over these past two years we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrongYes we disagreed plenty And yes there were times when Democrats had to go it aloneBut time and again Democrats and Republicans came togetherCame together to defend a stronger and safer EuropeCame together to pass a onceinageneration infrastructure law building bridges to connect our nation and peopleCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pitsIn fact I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you loveTo my Republican friends if we could work together in the last Congress there is no reason we cant work together in this new CongressThe people sent us a clear message Fighting for the sake of fighting power for the sake of power conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhereAnd thats always been my vision for our country To restore the soul of the nation To rebuild the backbone of America the middle class To unite the countryWeve been sent here to finish the jobFor decades the middle class was hollowed outToo many goodpaying manufacturing jobs moved overseas Factories at home closed downOncethriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to beAnd along the way something else was lostPride That sense of selfworthI ran for President to fundamentally change things to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we doTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down Because when the middle class does well the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well We all do wellAs my Dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck Its about your dignity Its about respect Its about being able to look your kid in the eye and say Honeyits going to be OK and mean itSo lets look at the results Unemployment rate at 34 a 50year low Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workersWeve already created 800000 goodpaying manufacturing jobs the fastest growth in 40 yearsWhere is it written that America cant lead the world in manufacturing againFor too many decades we imported products and exported jobsNow thanks to all weve done were exporting American products and creating American jobsInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putins war that disrupted energy and food suppliesBut were better positioned than any country on EarthWe have more to do but here at home inflation is coming downHere at home gas prices are down 150 a gallon since their peakFood inflation is coming downInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone upAdditionally over the last two years a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small businessEvery time somebody starts a small business its an act of hopeAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enactedStanding here last year I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilitySemiconductors the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more These chips were invented right here in AmericaAmerica used to make nearly 40 of the worlds chipsBut in the last few decades we lost our edge and were down to producing only 10 We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut downTodays automobiles need up to 3000 chips each but American automakers couldnt make enough cars because there werent enough chipsCar prices went up So did everything from refrigerators to cellphonesWe can never let that happen againThats why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science ActWere making sure the supply chain for America begins in AmericaWeve already created 800000 manufacturing jobs even without this lawWith this new law we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the countryThats going to come from companies that have announced more than 300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two yearsOutside of Columbus Ohio Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres a literal field of dreamsThatll create 10000 jobs 7000 construction jobs 3000 jobs once the factories are finishedJobs paying 130000 a year and many dont require a college degreeJobs where people dont have to leave home in search of opportunityAnd its just getting startedThink about the new homes new small businesses and so much more that will come to lifeTalk to mayors and Governors Democrats and Republicans and theyll tell you what this means to their communitiesWere seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartlandBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world we also need the best infrastructure in the worldWe used to be 1 in the world in infrastructure then we fell to 13thNow were coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhowers Interstate Highway SystemAlready weve funded over 20000 projects including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to PortlandThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways bridges railroads tunnels ports and airports clean water and highspeed internet across AmericaUrban Suburban Rural TribalAnd were just getting started I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the lawAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts dont worryI promised to be the president for all AmericansWell fund your projects And Ill see you at the groundbreakingThis law will help further unite all of AmericaMajor projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River Built 60 years ago Badly in need of repairsOne of the nations most congested freight routes carrying 2 billion worth of freight every day Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades but were finally going to get it doneI went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver 16 billion for this projectWhile I was there I met an ironworker named Sara who is here tonightFor 30 years shes been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44 known as the cowboys of the sky who built the Cincinnati skylineSara said she cant wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge Thats prideThats what were also buildingPrideWere also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400000 schools and childcare centers so every child in America can drink clean waterWere making sure that every community has access to affordable highspeed internetNo parent should have to drive to a McDonalds parking lot so their kid can do their homework onlineAnd when we do these projects were going to Buy AmericanBuy American has been the law of the land since 1933 But for too long past administrations have found ways to get around itNot anymoreTonight Im also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in AmericaAmericanmade lumber glass drywall fiber optic cablesAnd on my watch American roads American bridges and American highways will be made with American productsMy economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades too many people have been left behind or treated like theyre invisibleMaybe thats you watching at homeYou remember the jobs that went away And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving awayI get itThats why were building an economy where no one is left behindJobs are coming back pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years This is a bluecollar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your livesFor example too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer your child gets sick or if something happens to youWill you have the money to pay your medical bills Will you have to sell the houseI get it With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law were taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at nightYou know we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on EarthFor example one in ten Americans has diabetesEvery day millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive Insulin has been around for 100 years It costs drug companies just 10 a vial to makeBut Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollarsand making record profitsNot anymoreWe capped the cost of insulin at 35 a month for seniors on MedicareBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare including 200000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their livesLets finish the job this timeLets cap the cost of insulin at 35 a month for every American who needs itThis law also caps outofpocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum 2000 per year when there are in fact many drugs like expensive cancer drugs that can cost up to 10000 12000 and 14000 a yearIf drug prices rise faster than inflation drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the differenceAnd were finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices Bringing down prescription drug costs doesnt just save seniors moneyIt will cut the federal deficit saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for MedicareWhy wouldnt we want to do thatNow some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction ActMake no mistake if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs I will veto itIm pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in historyA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care ActThanks to the law I signed last year millions are saving 800 a year on their premiumsBut the way that law was written that benefit expires after 2025Lets finish the job make those savings permanent and expand coverage to those left off MedicaidLook the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisisLowering utility bills creating American jobs and leading the world to a clean energy futureIve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts storms and wildfiresIn addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho we are rebuilding for the long termNew electric grids able to weather the next major stormRoads and water systems to withstand the next big floodClean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behindWere building 500000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workersAnd helping families save more than 1000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energyefficient appliancesHistoric conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our landsLets face realityThe climate crisis doesnt care if your state is red or blue It is an existential threatWe have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it Im proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challengeBut theres so much more to doWe will finish the jobAnd we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair shareIm a capitalist But just pay your fair shareAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfairThe idea that in 2020 55 of the biggest companies in America made 40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxesThats simply not fairBut now because of the law I signed billiondollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15Just 15Thats less than a nurse pays Let me be clearUnder my plan nobody earning less than 400000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxesNobody Not one pennyBut theres more to doLets finish the job Reward work not just wealth Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum taxBecause no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighterYou may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profitsLast year they made 200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisisIts outrageousThey invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices downInstead they used those record profits to buy back their own stock rewarding their CEOs and shareholdersCorporations ought to do the right thingThats why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments insteadThey will still make a considerable profitLets finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxesInstead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by 114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheatsThats being fiscally responsibleIn the last two years my administration cut the deficit by more than 17 trillionthe largest deficit reduction in American historyUnder the previous administration Americas deficit went up four years in a rowBecause of those record deficits no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessorNearly 25 of the entire national debt a debt that took 200 years to accumulate was added by that administration aloneHow did Congress respond to all that debtThey lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisisThey paid Americas bills to prevent economic disaster for our countryTonight Im asking this Congress to follow suitLet us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never ever be questionedSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans All of you at home should know what their plans areInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five yearsThat means if Congress doesnt vote to keep them those programs will go awayOther Republicans say if we dont cut Social Security and Medicare theyll let America default on its debt for the first time in our historyI wont let that happenSocial Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniorsAmericans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started workingSo tonight lets all agree to stand up for seniors Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security We will not cut MedicareThose benefits belong to the American people They earned themIf anyone tries to cut Social Security I will stop them And if anyone tries to cut Medicare I will stop themI will not allow them to be taken awayNot today Not tomorrow Not everNext month when I offer my fiscal plan I ask my Republican friends to offer their planWe can sit down together and discuss both plans togetherMy plan will lower the deficit by 2 trillionI wont cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefitIn fact I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decadesI will not raise taxes on anyone making under 400000 a year And I will pay for the ideas Ive talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair shareLook heres the deal Big corporations arent just taking advantage of the tax code Theyre taking advantage of you the American consumerHeres my message to all of you out there I have your back Were already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills stopping 1 million surprise bills a monthWere protecting seniors lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud endanger patient safety or prescribe drugs they dont needMillions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids overthecounter without a prescriptionCapitalism without competition is not capitalism It is exploitationLast year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our countryI signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90 helping American farmers businesses and consumersLets finish the jobPass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantageMy administration is also taking on junk fees those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay moreFor example were making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayedWeve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees saving consumers more than 1 billion a yearWere cutting credit card late fees by 75 from 30 to 8Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in They add up to hundreds of dollars a monthThey make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family tripI know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with itNot anymoreWeve written a bill to stop all that Its called the Junk Fee Prevention ActWell ban surprise resort fees that hotels tack on to your bill These fees can cost you up to 90 a night at hotels that arent even resortsWell make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to 200 or more when you decide to switch to another providerWell cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfrontAnd well prohibit airlines from charging up to 50 roundtrip for families just to sit togetherBaggage fees are bad enoughthey cant just treat your child like a piece of luggageAmericans are tired of being played for suckersPass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us offFor too long workers have been getting stiffedNot anymoreWere beginning to restore the dignity of workFor example 30 million workers had to sign noncompete agreements when they took a job So a cashier at a burger place cant cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks moreNot anymoreWere banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what theyre worthIm so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizingPass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union And lets guarantee all workers a living wageLets also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days paid family and medical leave and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to workLets also restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the lowest level in historyAnd by the way when we do all of these things we increase productivity We increase economic growthLets also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housingLets get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved onesPass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing Gods workThese plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do themRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle classWhen we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century it made us the besteducated bestprepared nation in the worldBut the world has caught upJill who teaches fulltime has an expression Any nation that outeducates us will outcompete usFolks you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st CenturyIf you want America to have the besteducated workforce lets finish the job by providing access to preschool for 3 and 4yearoldsStudies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50 more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2 or 4year degree no matter their backgroundLets give public school teachers a raiseAnd were making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working and middleclass familiesLets finish the job connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college some of the best career training in America in addition to being a pathway to a fouryear degreeLets offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or notAnd folks in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed lets also recognize how far weve come in the fight against the pandemic itselfWhile the virus is not gone thanks to the resilience of the American people we have broken COVIDs grip on usCOVID deaths are down nearly 90Weve saved millions of lives and opened our country back upAnd soon well end the public health emergencyBut we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVIDFamilies grieving Children orphaned Empty chairs at the dining room tableWe remember them and we remain vigilantWe still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatmentsSo Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safeAnd as we emerge from this crisis stronger Im also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemicBefore I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined Fraud was rampantLast year I told you the watchdogs are back Since then weve recovered billions of taxpayer dollarsNow lets triple our antifraud strike forces going after these criminals double the statute of limitations on these crimes and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American peopleFor every dollar we put into fighting fraud taxpayers get back at least ten times as muchCOVID left other scars like the spike in violent crime in 2020 the first year of the pandemicWe have an obligation to make sure all our people are safePublic safety depends on public trust But too often that trust is violatedJoining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols who had to bury him just last week There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a childBut imagine what its like to lose a child at the hands of the lawImagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their carIve never had to have the talk with my childrenBeau Hunter and Ashleythat so many Black and Brown families have had with their childrenIf a police officer pulls you over turn on your interior lights Dont reach for your license Keep your hands on the steering wheelImagine having to worry like that every day in AmericaHeres what Tyres mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak outWith faith in God she said her son was a beautiful soul and something good will come from thisImagine how much courage and character that takesIts up to us Its up to all of usWe all want the same thingNeighborhoods free of violenceLaw enforcement who earn the communitys trustOur children to come home safelyEqual protection under the law thats the covenant we have with each other in AmericaAnd we know police officers put their lives on the line every day and we ask them to do too muchTo be counselors social workers psychologists responding to drug overdoses mental health crises and moreWe ask too much of themI know most cops are good decent people They risk their lives every time they put on that shieldBut what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too oftenWe have to do betterGive law enforcement the training they need hold them to higher standards and help them succeed in keeping everyone safeWe also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challengesMore resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime more community intervention programs more investments in housing education and job trainingAll this can help prevent violence in the first placeAnd when police officers or departments violate the publics trust we must hold them accountableWith the support of families of victims civil rights groups and law enforcement I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds restricting noknock warrants and other key elements of the George Floyd ActLets commit ourselves to make the words of Tyres mother come true something good must come from thisAll of us in this chamber we need to rise to this momentWe cant turn awayLets do what we know in our hearts we need to doLets come together and finish the job on police reformDo somethingThat was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde Do something on gun violenceThank God we did passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decadesThat includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21yearolds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and othersBut we know our work is not doneJoining us tonight is Brandon Tsay a 26yearold heroBrandon put off his college dreams to stay by his moms side as she was dying from cancer He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparentsTwo weeks ago during Lunar New Year celebrations he heard the studios front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at himHe thought he was going to die but then he thought about the people insideIn that instant he found the courage to act and wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studioHe saved lives Its time we do the same as wellBan assault weapons once and for allWe did it before I led the fight to ban them in 1994In the 10 years the ban was law mass shootings went down After Republicans let it expire mass shootings tripledLets finish the job and ban assault weapons againAnd lets also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was beforeWe now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border arresting 8000 human smugglers and seizing over 23000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several monthsSince we launched our new border plan last month unlawful migration from Cuba Haiti Nicaragua and Venezuela has come down 97But Americas border problems wont be fixed until Congress actsIf you wont pass my comprehensive immigration reform at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers those on temporary status farm workers and essential workersHere in the peoples House its our duty to protect all the peoples rights and freedomsCongress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v Wade to protect every womans constitutional right to chooseThe Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy But already more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bansMake no mistake if Congress passes a national abortion ban I will veto itLets also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans especially transgender young people can live with safety and dignityOur strength is not just the example of our power but the power of our example Lets remember the world is watchingI spoke from this chamber one year ago just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against UkraineA murderous assault evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War IIPutins invasion has been a test for the ages A test for America A test for the worldWould we stand for the most basic of principlesWould we stand for sovereigntyWould we stand for the right of people to live free from tyrannyWould we stand for the defense of democracyFor such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for wouldbe aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity One year later we know the answerYes we wouldAnd yes we didTogether we did what America always does at our bestWe ledWe united NATO and built a global coalitionWe stood against Putins aggressionWe stood with the Ukrainian peopleTonight we are once again joined by Ukraines Ambassador to the United States She represents not just her nation but the courage of her peopleAmbassador America is united in our support for your country We will stand with you as long as it takesOur nation is working for more freedom more dignity and more peace not just in Europe but everywhereBefore I came to office the story was about how the Peoples Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the worldNot anymoreIve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition not conflictI will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong Investing in American innovation in industries that will define the future and that Chinas government is intent on dominatingInvesting in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so theyre not used against usModernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggressionToday were in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the worldI am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the worldBut make no mistake as we made clear last week if Chinas threatens our sovereignty we will act to protect our country And we didAnd lets be clear winning the competition with China should unite all of us We face serious challenges across the worldBut in the past two years democracies have become stronger not weakerAutocracies have grown weaker not strongerAmerica is rallying the world again to meet those challenges from climate and global health to food insecurity to terrorism and territorial aggressionAllies are stepping up spending more and doing moreAnd bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they areIts never a good bet to bet against AmericaWhen I came to office most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible But I never believed itThats why a year ago I offered a Unity Agenda for the nationWeve made real progressTogether we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addictionPassed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental healthLaunched ARPAH to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer Alzheimers diabetes and so much moreWe passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story

addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdoseShe was 20 years oldDescribing the last eight years without her Doug said There is no worse painYet their family has turned pain into purpose working to end stigma and change lawsHe told us he wants to start the journey towards Americas recoveryDoug were with youFentanyl is killing more than 70000 Americans a yearLets launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production sale and trafficking with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the borderWorking with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl traffickingSecond lets do more on mental health especially for our children When millions of young people are struggling with bullying violence trauma we owe them greater access to mental health care at schoolWe must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profitAnd its time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online ban targeted advertising to children and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of usThird lets do more to keep our nations one truly sacred obligation to equip those we send into harms way and care for them and their families when they come homeJob

gave up hope She turns four next monthThey just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free and shes watching from the White House tonightFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big thingsTwenty years ago under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIVAIDS Its been a huge successI believe we can do the same with cancerLets end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for allTheres one reason why were able to do all of these things our democracy itselfIts the most fundamental thing of allWith democracy everything is possible Without it nothing isFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened attacked and put at riskPut to the test here in this very room on January 6thAnd then just a few months ago unhinged by the Big Lie an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the thenSpeaker of this House of Representatives Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6thHere tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they getMy friend Paul PelosiBut such a heinous act never should have happenedWe must all speak out There is no place for political violence in America In America we must protect the right to vote not suppress that fundamental right We honor the results of our elections not subvert the will of the people We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracyAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harborDemocracy must not be a partisan issue It must be an American issueEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy to defend it to stand up for itAnd this is our momentMy fellow Americans we meet tonight at an inflection point One of those moments that only a few generations ever face where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to comeWe are not bystanders to history We are not powerless before the forces that confront us It is within our power of We the People We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at handWe must be the nation we have always been at our best Optimistic Hopeful ForwardlookingA nation that

"September 21, 2022: Speech before the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/september-21-2022-speech-77th-session-united-nations-general,Joe Biden,2022-09-21,"President Joe Biden addresses the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. He speaks out against Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, and he calls for a recommitment to the UN charter and its principles. He also recounts the threat to the world from climate change and outlines steps to thwart its effects. He ends by committing the United States to human rights and the values of the UN, commenting that the UN is ""at its core, an act of dauntless hope.""",Thank you Mr President Mr SecretaryGeneral my fellow leaders in the last year our world has experienced great upheaval a growing crisis in food insecurity record heat floods and droughts COVID19 inflation and a brutal needless wara war chosen by one man to be very blunt Let us speak plainly A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charterno more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force Again just today President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the nonproliferation regime Now Russia is callingcalling up more soldiers to join the fight And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine an extremely significant violation of the UN Charter This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened But no one threatened Russia and no one other than Russia sought conflict In fact we warned it was coming And with many of you we worked to try to avert itPutins own words make his true purpose unmistakable Just before he invaded Putin assertedand I quoteUkraine was created by Russia and never had quote real statehoodAnd now we see attacks on schools railway stations hospitals waon centers of Ukrainian history and culture In the past even more horrifying evidence of Russias atrocity and war crimes mass graves uncovered in Izyum bodies according to those that excavated those bodies showing signs of torture This war is about extinguishing Ukraines right to exist as a state plain and simple and Ukraines right to exist as a people Whoever you are wherever you live whatever you believe that should notthat should make your blood run coldThats why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russias war against Ukraine The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukrainemore than 25 billion to date Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well And today more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself The United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia to deter attacks against NATO territory to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimesBecause if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for EverythingEvery victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers But this past year the world was tested as well and we did not hesitate We chose liberty We chose sovereignty We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding We stood with UkraineLike you the United States wants this war to end on just terms on terms we all signed up for that you cannot seize a nations territory by force The only country standing in the way of that is Russia So weeach of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as members of the United Nationsmust be clear firm and unwavering in our resolve Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine We will stand in solidarity against Russias aggression PeriodNow its no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy the United Statesand I as Presidentchampion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world Because I believe democracy remains humanitys greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time Were working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well But as we meet today the UN Charterthe UN Charters very basis of a stable and just rulebased order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world it was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies united in their commitment to work for peace As President Truman said in 1945 the UN Charterand I quoteis proof that nations like men can state their differences can face them and then can find common ground on which to stand End of quoteThat common ground was so straightforward so basic that today 193 of you193 member stateshave willingly embraced its principles And standing up for those principles for the UN Charter is the job of every responsible member state I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshedTo stand against global politics of fear and coercion to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation respect for international law and arms controlno matter what else we may disagree on that is the common ground upon which we must stand If youre still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world then the United States wants to work with you I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of todays worldMembers of the UN Security Council including the United States should consistently uphold and defend the UN Charter and refrainrefrain from the use of the veto except in rare extraordinary situations to ensure that the Council remains credible and effectiveThat is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and nonpermanent representatives of the Council This includes permanent seats for those nations weve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa Latin America and the CaribbeanThe United States is committed to this vital work In every region we pursued new constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests from elevating the Quad in the IndoPacific to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful integrated Middle East to hosting the USAfrica Leaders Summit inthis DecemberAs I said last year the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to peoples livesall peoples lives tackling the climate crisis as the previous speaker spoke to strengthening global health security feeding the worldfeeding the worldWe made that priority And one year later were keeping that promiseFrom the day I came to office weve led with a bold climate agenda We rejoined the Paris Agreement convened major climate summits helped deliver critical agreements on COP26 And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 15 degrees Celsius And now Ive signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country 369 billion toward climate change That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar doubling down on zero emission vehicles increasing energy efficiency supporting clean manufacturingOur Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce US emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of cleanenergypowered economic growthOur investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide not just the United States This is a global gamechangerand none too soon We dont have much timeWe all know were already living in a climate crisis No one seems to doubt it after this past year As we meet much of Pakistan is still underwater it needs help Meanwhile the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought Families are facing impossible choices choosing which child to feed and wondering whether theyll surviveThis is the human cost of climate change And its growing not lesseningSo as I announced last year to meet our global responsibility my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than 11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lowerincome countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transitionThe key part of that will be our PREPARE plan which will help half a billion people and especially vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilienceThis need is enormous So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient sustainable clean energy economy to preserve our planetOn global health weve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world with more available to help meet countries needsall free of charge no strings attachedAnd were working closely with the G20 and other countries And the United States helped lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention Preparedness and Response at the World BankAt the same time weve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challengesLater today Ill host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria With bipartisan support in our Congress I have pledged to contribute up to 6 billion to that effortSo I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of historyWere also taking on the food crisis head on With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acuteacute food insecuritya jump of 40 million in a yeartoday Im announcing another 29 billion in US support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year aloneRussia in the meantime is pumping out lies trying to pin the blame for the crisisthe food crisisonto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine So let me be perfectly clear about something Our sanctions explicitly allowexplicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer No limitation Its Russias war that is worsening food insecurity and only Russia can end itIm grateful for the work here at the UNincluding your leadership Mr SecretaryGeneralestablishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months and we need to make sure its extendedWe believe strongly in the need to feed the world Thats why the United States is the worlds largest supporter of the World Food Programme with more than 40 percent of its budgetWere leading supportwere leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world And to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity the United States introduced a Call to Action a roadmap eliminating global food insecurityto eliminating global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member states have already supportedIn June the G7 announced more than 45 billion to strengthen food security around the worldThrough USAIDs Feed the Future initiative the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought and heatresistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using lessAnd were calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering Because in every country in the world no matter what else divides us if parents cannot feed their children nothingnothing else matters if parents cannot feed their childrenAs we look to the future were working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st centuryWe launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologieskey technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone With our partner countries and through the UN were supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibilityresponsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security With partners in the Americas Africa Europe and the Middle East and the IndoPacific were working to build a new economic ecosystem whilewhere every nationevery nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient sustainable and shared Thats why the United States has championed a global minimum tax And we will work to see it implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhereeverywhereIts also been the idea behind the IndoPacific Economic Framework which the United States launched this year with 13 other IndoPacific economies Were working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical IndoPacific region that is free and open connected and prosperous secure and resilientTogether with partners around the world were working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weaponAnd as Russias war rolls the global economy were also calling on major global creditors including the nonParis Club countries to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lowerincome countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages lets meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investmentshighstandard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environmentkeyed to the needs of the communities they serve not to the contributorThats why the United States together with fellow G7 partners launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment We intend to collectively mobilize 600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027 Dozens of projects are already underway industrialscale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal transformative solar projects in Angola firstofitskind small modular nuclear power plant in RomaniaThese are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries but for everyone The United States will work with every nation including our competitors to solve global problems like climate change Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation and walking away hurts the entire worldLet me be direct about the competition between the United States and China As we manage shifting geopolitical trends the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader We do not seek conflict We do not seek a Cold War We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free open secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations investments that are designed not to foster dependency but to alleviate burdens and help nations become selfsufficient partnerships not to create political obligation but because we know our own successeach of our success is increased when other nations succeed as wellWhen individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents everyone benefits Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution increasing peace and security for everyone everywhere The United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits We remain committed to our One China policy which has helped prevent conflict for four decades And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side We support an African Unionled peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people In Venezuela where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country we urge a Venezuelanled dialogue and a return to free and fair electionsWe continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces politicalfueled gang violence and an enormous human crisisAnd we call on the world to do the same We have more to do Well continue to back the UNmediated truce in Yemen which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of warAnd we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people The United States is committed to Israels security full stop And a negotiated twostate solution remains in our view the best way to ensure Israels security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state whichto which they are entitledboth sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens both people enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignityLet me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime through diplomacy No matter what else is happening in the world the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January But today were seeing disturbing trends Russia shunned the NonProliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference And again today as I said theyre making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons China is conducting an unprecedented concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate UN sanctionsAnd while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations the United States is clear We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weaponI continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome The nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution We cannot let the world now slide backwards nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rightsPerhaps singular among this bodys achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselvesThey made clear in 1948 Human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve And yet today in 2022 fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world from the violations ofin Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of UNUSreports detailing by the US UN High Commissioner to the horrible abuses against prodemocracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in AfghanistanAnd today we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rightsBut heres what I know The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations where women and girls can exercise equal rights including basic reproductive rights and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities where the LGBTQ community individuals live and love freely without being targeted with violence where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisalThe United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter in our own country and around the worldLet me end with this This institution guided by the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at its core an act of dauntless hopeLet me say that again Its an act of dauntless hopeThink about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smolderingThink about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions dead the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposedThey had every right to believe only the worst of humanity Instead they reached for what was best in all of us and they strove to build something better enduring peace comity among nations equal rights for every member of the human family cooperation for the advancement of all humankindMy fellow leaders the challenges we face today are great indeed but our capacity is greater Our commitment must be greater stillSo lets stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still that we stand for the values of the UN Charter that we still believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children although none of us have fully achieved itWere not passive witnesses to history we are the authors of historyWe can do thiswe have to do itfor ourselves and for our future for humankindThank you for your tolerance for listening to me I appreciate it very much God bless you all
"September 1, 2022: Remarks on the Continued Battle for the Soul of the Nation",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/september-1-2022-remarks-continued-battle-soul-nation,Joe Biden,2022-09-01,"President Joe Biden speaks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, about the state of American democracy. He warns against threats from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans, who are unwilling to admit defeat in the 2020 election and threaten political violence if they do not get their way. Biden stresses the tenets of US democracy such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, and liberty and justice for all.",THE PRESIDENT My fellow Americans please if you have a seat take it I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America Independence Hall in Philadelphia Pennsylvania This is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago with an idea unique among nations that in America were all created equal This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of selfgovernment the world has ever known with three simple words We the People We the People These two documents and the ideas they embodyequality and democracyare the rock upon which this nation is built They are how we became the greatest nation on Earth They are why for more than two centuries America has been a beacon to the world But as I stand here tonight equality and democracy are under assault We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise So tonight I have come this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it We must never forget We the people are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago We the people have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Halla flame that lit our way through abolition the Civil War Suffrage the Great Depression world wars Civil Rights That sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous free and just That is the work of my presidency a mission I believe in with my whole soul But first we must be honest with each other and with ourselves Too much of whats happening in our country today is not normal Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic Now I want to be very clearvery clear up front Not every Republican not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology I know because Ive been able to work with these mainstream Republicans But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans and that is a threat to this country These are hard things But Im an American Presidentnot the President of red America or blue America but of all America And I believe it is my dutymy duty to level with you to tell the truth no matter how difficult no matter how painful And here in my view is what is true MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution They do not believe in the rule of law They do not recognize the will of the people They refuse to accept the results of a free election And theyre working right now as I speak in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwardsbackwards to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy no right to contraception no right to marry who you love They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights to the pursuit of justice to the rule of law to the very soul of this country They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6thbrutally attacking law enforcementnot as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy but they look at them as patriots And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people This time theyre determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people Thats why respected conservatives like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans quote a clear and present danger to our democracy But while the threat to American democracy is real I want to say as clearly as we can We are not powerless in the face of these threats We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy There are far more Americansfar more Americans from everyfrom every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it And folks it is within our power its in our handsyours and mineto stop the assault on American democracy I believe America is at an inflection pointone of those moments that determine the shape of everything thats to come after And now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards To build the future or obsess about the past To be a nation of hope and unity and optimism or a nation of fear division and of darkness MAGA Republicans have made their choice They embrace anger They thrive on chaos They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies But togethertogether we can choose a different path We can choose a better path Forward to the future A future of possibility A future to build and dream and hope And were on that path moving ahead I know this nation I know you the American people I know your courage I know your hearts And I know our history This is a nation that honors our Constitution We do not reject it This is a nation that believes in the rule of law We do not repudiate it This is a nation that respects free and fair elections We honor the will of the people We do not deny it And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool We do not encourage violence We are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others patriotism liberty justice for all hope possibilities We are still at our core a democracy And yet history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy For a long time weve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed but its not We have to defend it protect it stand up for iteach and every one of usThats why tonight Im asking our nation to come together unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology Were all called by duty and conscience to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else Democrats independents mainstream Republicans We must be stronger more determined and more committed to saving American democracy than MAGA Republicans are toto destroying American democracy We the people will not let anyone or anything tear us apart Today there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail We hearyouve heard itmore and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country Its not It can never be an acceptable tool So I want to say this plain and simple There is no place for political violence in America Period None Ever We saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th Weve seen election officials poll workersmany of them volunteers of both partiessubjected to intimidation and death threats Andcan you believe itFBI agents just doing their job as directed facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens On top of that there are public figurestoday yesterday and the day beforepredicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streetsThis is inflammatory Its dangerous Its against the rule of law And we the people must say This is not who we are Ladies and gentlemen we cant be proinsurrectionist and proAmerican Theyre incompatible We cant allow violence to be normalized in this country Its wrong We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster Now We cant let the integrity of our elections be undermined for that is a path to chaos Look I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America I get it I believe in the giveandtake of politics in disagreement and debate and dissent Were a big complicated country But democracy endures only if we the people respect the guardrails of the republic Only if we the people accept the results of free and fair elections Only if we the people see politics not as total war but mediation of our differences Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election either they win or they were cheated And thats where MAGA Republicans are today They dont understand what every patriotic American knows You cant love your country only when you win Its fundamental American democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me only if we respect our legitimate political differences I will not stand by and watchI will notthe will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless evidencefree claims of fraud I will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refuse to accept that they lost I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this countrythe freedom to vote and have your vote countedandbe taken from you and the American people Look as your President I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being and Im asking every American to join me Throughout our history America has often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments like youre hearing in that bullhorn I believe we can and we must do that again and we are MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair They spread fear and lieslies told for profit and power But I see a very different Americaan America with an unlimited future an America that is about to take off I hope you see it as well Just look around I believed we could lift America from the depths of COVID so we passed the largest economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt And today Americas economy is faster stronger than any other advanced nation in the world We have more to go I believed we could build a better America so we passed the biggest infrastructure investment since President Dwight D Eisenhower And weve now embarked on a decade of rebuildingthe nations roads bridges highways ports water systems highspeed Internet railroads I believed we could make America safer so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton I believed we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and healthcare more affordable so we passed the most significant healthcare reforms since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act And I believed we could createwe could create a clean energy future and save the planet so we passed the most important climate initiative ever ever ever The cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done but they are wrong There is not a single thing America cannot donot a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together Its never easy But were proving that in America no matter how long the road progress does come Look I know the last yearfew years have been tough But today COVID no longer controls our lives More Americans are working than ever Businesses are growing Our schools are open Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and the compensation American manufacturing has come alive across the Heartland and the future will be made in Americano matter what the white supremacists and the extremists say I made a bet on you the American people and that bet is paying off Proving that from darkness the darkness of Charlottesville of COVID of gun violence of insurrectionwe can see the light Light is now visible Light that will guide us forward not only in words but in actionsactions for you for your children for your grandchildren for America Even in this moment with all the challenges we face I give you my word as a Biden Ive never been more optimistic about Americas future Not because of me but because of who you are Were going to end cancer as we know it Mark my words We are going to create millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy Were going to think big Were going to make the 21st century another American century because the world needs us to Thats where we need to focus our energynot in the past not on divisive culture wars not on the politics of grievance but on a future we can build together The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed everyone else has to fail They believe Americanot like I believe about America I believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed and that is the nation were building a nation where no one is left behind I ran for President because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation I still believe that to be true I believe the soul is the breath the life and the essence of who we are The soul is what makes us us The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God That all are entitled to be treated with decency dignity and respect That all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence And that democracydemocracy must be defended for democracy makes all these things possible Folks and its up to us Democracy begins and will be preserved in we the peoples habits of heart in our character optimism that is tested yet endures courage that digs deep when we need it empathy that fuels democracy the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow AmericansLook our democracy is imperfect It always has been Notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there Theyre entitled to be outrageous This is a democracy But history and common sensegood manners is nothing theyve ever suffered from But history and common sense tell us that opportunity liberty and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy We have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding but every generation has opened those doors a little wider to include more people who have been excluded before My fellow Americans America is an ideathe most powerful idea in the history of the world And it beats in the hearts of the people of this country It beats in all of our hearts It unites America It is the American creed The idea that America guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity It gives hate no safe harbor It installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life theres nothing you cant achieve Thats who we are Thats what we stand for Thats what we believe And that is precisely what we are doing opening doors creating new possibilities focusing on the future And were only just beginning Our task is to make our nation free and fair just and strong noble and whole And this work is the work of democracythe work of this generation It is the work of our time for all time We cant afford to haveleave anyone on the sidelines We need everyone to do their part So speak up Speak out Get engaged Vote vote vote And if we all do our dutyif we do our duty in 2022 and beyond then ages still to come will say weall of us herewe kept the faith We preserved democracy We heeded not our worst instincts but our better angels And we proved that for all its imperfections America is still the beacon to the world an ideal to be realized a promise to be kept There is nothing more important nothing more sacred nothing more American Thats our soul Thats who we truly are And thats who mustwe must always be And I have no doubtnonethat this is who we will be and that well come together as a nation That well secure our democracy That for the next 200 years well have what we had the past 200 years the greatest nation on the face of the Earth We just need to remember who we are We are the United States of America The United States of America And may God protect our nation And may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy God bless you all Democracy Thank you

He points to the unity of the democracies in Europe and their resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. He pleads to the Russian people to know that they are not the enemy but the United States and its allies will fight against President Vladimir Putin and his supporters to free Ukraine.",THE PRESIDENT Thank you thank you thank you Please if you have a seat be seated Laughter If you dont come up on stageThank you very much Its a great honor to be here Mr President they tell me youre over there somewhere There you are Thank you Mr President Be not afraid They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978 They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II Words that would change the worldJohn Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979 It was a message about the powerthe power of faith the power of resilience and the power of the people In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979 the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron CurtainThen a year later the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland And while I know he couldnt be here tonight were all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wasa Applause It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard Faith sees best in the dark And there were dark momentsTen years later the Soviet Union collapsed and Poland and Central and Eastern Europe would soon be free Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy It was a long painful slog fought over not days and months but years and decadesBut we emerged anew in the great battle for freedom a battle between democracy and autocracy between liberty and repression between a rulesbased order and one governed by brute forceIn this battle we need to be cleareyed This battle will not be won in days or months either We need to steel ourselves for the long fight aheadMr President Mr Prime Minister Mr Mayor members of the Parliament distinguished guests and the people of Poland and I suspect some people of Ukraine that are here Wereapplausewe are gathered here at the Royal Castle in this city that holds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe but humankinds unending search for freedomFor generations Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailedIn fact it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under Soviet domination came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidentsHer name was Madeleine Korbel Albright She becameapplauseone of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world She was a friend with whom I served Americas first woman Secretary of State She passed away three days agoShe fought her whole life for essential democratic principles And now in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nationAnd their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for an essential democratic principles that unite all free people the rule of law free and fair elections the freedom to speak to write and to assemble the freedom to worship as one chooses freedom of the pressThese principles are essential in a free society Applause But they have alwaysthey have always been under siege Theyve always been embattled Every generation has had to defeat democracys mortal foes Thats the way of the worldfor the world is imperfect as we know Where the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of manyMy message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to Ukraines Foreign Minister and Defense Minister who I believe are here tonight We stand with you Period Todays fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battle in a long struggle Hungary 1956 Poland 1956 then again 1981 Czechoslovakia 1968 Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings but the resistance continued until finally in 1989 the Berlin Wall and all of the walls of Soviet dominationthey fell They fell And the people prevailed But the battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold WarOver the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe Its hallmarks are familiar ones contempt for the rule of law contempt for democratic freedom contempt for the truth itselfToday Russia has strangled democracyhas sought to do so elsewhere not only in its homeland Under false claims of ethnic solidarity it has invalidated invaded neighboring nationsPutin has the gall to say hes deNazifying Ukraine Its a lie Its just cynical He knows that And its also obscenePresident Zelenskyy was democratically elected Hes Jewish His fathers family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust And Putin has the audacity like all autocrats before him to believe that might will make rightIn my own country a former president named Abraham Lincoln voiced the opposing spirit to save our Union in the midst of a civil war He said Let us have faith that right makes might Right makes might Today let us now have that faith again Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the denigns sic of ourthe designs of autocracy Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all timeThe Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing Russia Nothing is further from the truth NATO is a defensive alliance It has never sought the demise of RussiaIn the leadup to the current crisis the United States and NATO worked for months to engage Russia to avert a war I met with him in person and talked to him many times on the phone Time and again we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security enhance transparency and build confidence on all sidesBut Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation with lies and ultimatums Russia was bent on violence from the startI know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying They are going to cross the border They are going to attack Repeatedly he asserted We have no interest in war Guaranteed he would not move Repeatedly saying he would not invade UkraineRepeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for trainingall 180000 of them There is simply no justification or provocation for Russias choice of war Its an example of one of the oldest of human impulses using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and controlIts nothing less than a direct challenge to the rulebased international order established since the end of World War TwoAnd it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rulebased order was put in place We cannot go back to that We cannot The gravity of the threat is why the response of the West has been so swift and so powerful and so unified unprecedented and overwhelmingSwift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course Within days of its invasion the West had moved jointly with sanctions to damage Russias economyRussias Central Bank is now blocked from the global financial systems denying Kremlins access to the war fund it stashed around the globeWeve aimed at the heart of Russias economy by stopping the imports of Russian energy to the United StatesTo date the United States has sanctioned 140 Russian oligarchs and their family members seizing their illbegotten gains their yachts their luxury apartments their mansionsWeve sanctioned more than 400 Russian government officials including key architects of this warThese officials and oligarchs have reaped enormous benefit from the corruption connected to the Kremlin and now they have to share in the pain The private sector is acting as well Over 400 private multinational companies have pulled out of doing business in Russialeft Russia completelyfrom oil companies to McDonaldsAs a result of these unprecedented sanctions the ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble The Russian economyapplausethats true by the way It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years It was rankedRussias economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this evasion sicinvasion It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world Taken together these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military mightThese international sanctions are sapping Russian strength its ability to replenish its military and its abilityits ability to project power And it is Putinit is Vladimir Putin who is to blame period At the same time alongside these economic sanctions the Western world has come together to provide for the people of Ukraine with incredible levels of military economic and humanitarian assistanceIn the years before the invasion we America had sent over 650 million before they crossed the border in weapons to Ukraine including antiair and antiarmor equipmentSince the invasion America has committed another 135 billion in weapons and ammunitionAnd thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian peopleapplausethe equipment weve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace Our Allies and partners have stepped up as wellBut as Ive made clear American forces are in Europenot in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces American forces are here to defend NATO AlliesYesterday I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATOs frontline defenses The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine Dont even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territoryWe have a sacred obligationapplausewe have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective powerAnd earlier today I visited your National Stadium where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask My God whats going to happen to me Whats going to happen to my familyI saw tears in many of the mothers eyes as I embraced them their young childrentheir young children not sure whether to smile or cry One little girl said Mr Presidentshe spoke a little Englishis my brother and my daddyare they going to be okay Will I see them again Without their husbands their fathers in many cases their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their countryI didnt have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes the way they gripped my hand and little kids hung on to my leg praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over againBut I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsawfor that matter all the Polish peoplefor the depths of their compassion their willingness to reach outapplauseopening their heartsI was saying to the Mayor theyre preparing to open their hearts and their homes simply to help I also want to thank my friend the great American chef Jos Andrs and his team who helped feeling sic thoseapplausefeeding those who are yearning to be free But helping these refugees is not something Poland or any other nation should carry alone All the world democracies have a responsibility to help All of them And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibilityIve announced two days ago we will welcome 100000 Ukrainian refugees We already have 8000 a week coming to the United States of other natnationalitiesWell provide nearly 300 million of humanitarian assistance providing tens of thousands of tons of food water medicine and other basic suppliesIn Brussels I announced the United States is prepared to provide more than 1 billion in addition in humanitarian aidThe World Food Programme told us that despite significant obstacles at least some relief is getting to major cities in Ukraine but not Metropol sicno excuse me Marnot Mariupol because Russian forces are blocking relief suppliesBut well not cease our efforts to get humanitarian relief wherever it is needed in Ukraine and for the people whove made it out of UkraineNotwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already Having lost children myselfI know thats no solace to the people whove lost familyBut he Putin thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight Not much of a student of history Instead Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistanceRather than breaking Ukrainian resolve Russias brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve Rather than driving NATO apart the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border but now he has we have a stronger presence a larger presence with over a hundred thousand American troops here along with all the other members of NATOIn factapplauseRussia has managed to cause something Im sure he never intended The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that wed once taken years to accomplishIts not only Russias actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracys blessing Its our own countryhis own country the Kremlin is jailing protestors Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left Theres a brain drainleaving Russia Shutting down independent news State media is all propaganda blocking the image of civilian targets mass graves starvation tactics of the Russian forces in UkraineIs it any wonder as I said that 200000 Russians have all left their country in one month A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time which brings me to my message to the Russian peopleIve worked with Russian leaders for decades I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold WarIve always spoken directly and honestly to you the Russian people Let me say this if youre able to listen You the Russian people are not our enemy I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals schools maternity wards that for Gods sake are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission Millions of families are being driven from their homes including half of all Ukraines children These are not the actions of a great nation Of all people you the Russian people as well as all people across Europe still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the late thirties and fortiesthe situation of World War Twostill fresh in the minds of many grandparents in the regionWhatwhatever your generation experiencedwhether it experienced the Siege of Leningrad or heard about it from your parents and grandparentstrain stations overflowing with terrified families fleeing their homes nights sheltering in basements and cellars mornings sitting through the rubble in your homesthese are not memories of the past Not anymore Because its exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now March 26 2022 Just days beforewere at the twentyfiryou were a 21st century nation with hopes and dreams that people all over the world have for themselves and their family Now Vladimir Putins aggression have cut you the Russian people off from the rest of the world and its taking Russia back to the 19th centuryThis is not who you are This is not the future reserveyou deserve for your families and your children Im telling you the truth This war is not worthy of you the Russian peoplePutin can and must end this war The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peaceAnd my message to the rest of Europe This new battle for freedom has already made a few things crystal clear First Europe must end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels And we the United States will help Thats why just yesterday in Brussels I announced a plan with the President of the European Commission to get Europe through the immediate energy crisisOver the long term as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean renewable energy And well work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over They must end They must endAnd second we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chanceAnd finally and most urgently we maintain absolute unitywe mustamong the worlds democraciesIts not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish of ennobling words of democracy of freedom equality and liberty All of us including here in Poland must do the hard work of democracy each and every day My country as wellThats whyapplausethats why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO for the G7 for the European Union for all freedomloving nations We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come It will not be easy There will be costs But its a price we have to pay Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhereTime and again history shows that its from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows And history shows this is the task of our time the task of this generationLets remember The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader it was the people of Europe who for decades fought to free themselvesTheir sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the PanEuropean Picnic They joined hands for the Baltic Way They stood for Solidarity here in Poland And together it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstandAnd were seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator So in this hour let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today Never ever give up hope never doubt never tire never become discouraged Be not afraid A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a peoples love for liberty Brutality will never grind down their will to be free Ukraine will never be a victory for Russiafor free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darknessWe will have a different futurea brighter future rooted in democracy and principle hope and light of decency and dignity of freedom and possibilities For Gods sake this man cannot remain in power God bless you all And may God defend our freedom And may God protect our troops Thank you for your patience Thank you Thank you Thank you
"March 1, 2022: State of the Union Address",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-1-2022-state-union-address,Joe Biden,2022-03-01,"President Joe Biden delivers his first State of the Union address. As is typical for State of the Union addresses, his speech covers many topics. He begins with a pledge to defend the country of Ukraine from the Russian invasion and details the steps the United States has taken with its NATO allies to thwart President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He then talks about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts that the US government has taken to help the American people. He also advocates for lower prescription drug prices, especially for insulin, and lays out his plan to help support American workers and businesses.",SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI Members of Congress I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States THE PRESIDENT Madam Speaker Madam Vice President our First Lady and Second Gentleman Members of Congress and the Cabinet Justices of the Supreme Court My fellow Americans Last year COVID19 kept us apart This year we are finally together again Tonight we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents But most importantly as Americans With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny Six days ago Russias Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways But he badly miscalculated He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined He met the Ukrainian people From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian their fearlessness their courage their determination inspires the world Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament Light will win over darkness The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world Please rise if you are able and show that Yes we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people Throughout our history weve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos They keep moving And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising Thats why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2 The United States is a member along with 29 other nations It matters American diplomacy matters American resolve matters Putins latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy He thought the West and NATO wouldnt respond And he thought he could divide us at home Putin was wrong We were ready Here is what we did We prepared extensively and carefully We spent months building a coalition of other freedomloving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin I spent countless hours unifying our European allies We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression We countered Russias lies with truth And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable Along with twentyseven members of the European Union including France Germany Italy as well as countries like the United Kingdom Canada Japan Korea Australia New Zealand and many others even Switzerland We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever Together with our allies we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions We are cutting off Russias largest banks from the international financial system Preventing Russias central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putins 630 Billion war fund worthless We are choking off Russias access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more The US Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets We are coming for your illbegotten gains And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flightsfurther isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value and trading remains suspended Russias economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom Military assistance Economic assistance Humanitarian assistance We are giving more than 1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering Let me be clear our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Alliesin the event that Putin decides to keep moving west For that purpose weve mobilized American ground forces air squadrons and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland Romania Latvia Lithuania and Estonia As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power And we remain cleareyed The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage But the next few days weeks months will be hard on them Putin has unleashed violence and chaos But while he may make gains on the battlefield he will pay a continuing high price over the long run And a proud Ukrainian people who have known 30 years of independence have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards To all Americans I will be honest with you as Ive always promised A Russian dictator invading a foreign country has costs around the world And Im taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russias economy And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers Tonight I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world America will lead that effort releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve And we stand ready to do more if necessary unified with our allies These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home And I know the news about whats happening can seem alarming But I want you to know that we are going to be okay When the history of this era is written Putins war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger While it shouldnt have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see whats at stake now everyone sees it clearly We see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine In the battle between democracy and autocracy democracies are rising to the moment and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security This is a real test Its going to take time So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people He will never extinguish their love of freedom He will never weaken the resolve of the free world We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced The pandemic has been punishing And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food gas housing and so much more I understand I remember when my dad had to leave our home in Scranton Pennsylvania to find work I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up you felt it Thats why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan Because people were hurting We needed to act and we did Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID19 It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans Helped put food on their table keep a roof over their heads and cut the cost of health insurance And as my dad used to say it gave people a little breathing room And unlike the 2trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans the American Rescue Plan helped working peopleand left no one behind And it worked It created jobs Lots of jobs In factour economy created over 65 million new jobs just last year more jobs created in one year than ever before in the history of America Our economy grew at a rate of 57 percent last year the strongest growth in nearly 40 years the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasnt worked for the working people of this nation for too long For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top the benefits would trickle down to everyone else But that trickledown theory led to weaker economic growth lower wages bigger deficits and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America Invest in America Educate Americans Grow the workforce Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down Because we know that when the middle class grows the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well America used to have the best roads bridges and airports on Earth Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world We wont be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we dont fix that Thats why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Lawthe most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history This was a bipartisan effort and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen Were done talking about infrastructure weeks Were going to have an infrastructure decade It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the worldparticularly with China As Ive told Xi Jinping it is never a good bet to bet against the American people Well create good jobs for millions of Americans modernizing roads airports ports and waterways all across America And well do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice Well build a national network of 500000 electric vehicle charging stations begin to replace poisonous lead pipesso every childand every Americanhas clean water to drink at home and at school provide affordable highspeed internet for every Americanurban suburban rural and tribal communities 4000 projects have already been announced And tonight Im announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65000 miles of highway and 1500 bridges in disrepair When we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild Americawe are going to Buy American buy American products to support American jobs The federal government spends about 600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure Theres been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers dollars support American jobs and businesses Every Administration says theyll do it but we are actually doing it We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America But to compete for the best jobs of the future we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors Thats why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing Let me give you one example of why its so important to pass it If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus Ohio youll find 1000 empty acres of land It wont look like much but if you stop and look closely youll see a Field of dreams the ground on which Americas future will be built This is where Intel the American company that helped build Silicon Valley is going to build its 20 billion semiconductor mega site Up to eight stateoftheart factories in one place 10000 new goodpaying jobs Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives Smartphones The Internet Technology we have yet to invent But thats just the beginning Intels CEO Pat Gelsinger who is here tonight told me they are ready to increase their investment from 20 billion to 100 billion That would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history And all theyre waiting for is for you to pass this bill So lets not wait any longer Send it to my desk Ill sign it And we will really take off And Intel is not alone Theres something happening in America Just look around and youll see an amazing story The rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products Made in America The revitalization of American manufacturing Companies are choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago they would have built them overseas Thats what is happening Ford is investing 11 billion to build electric vehicles creating 11000 jobs across the country GM is making the largest investment in its history7 billion to build electric vehicles creating 4000 jobs in Michigan All told we created 369000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year Powered by people Ive met like JoJo Burgess from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh whos here with us tonight As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says Its time to bury the label Rust Belt Its time But with all the bright spots in our economy record job growth and higher wages too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel I get it Thats why my top priority is getting prices under control Look our economy roared back faster than most predicted but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories The pandemic also disrupted global supply chains When factories close it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store and prices go up Look at cars Last year there werent enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy And guess what prices of automobiles went up Sowe have a choice One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer I have a better plan to fight inflation Lower your costs not your wages Make more cars and semiconductors in America More infrastructure and innovation in America More goods moving faster and cheaper in America More jobs where you can earn a good living in America And instead of relying on foreign supply chains lets make it in America Economists call it increasing the productive capacity of our economy I call it building a better America My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease longterm inflationary pressures Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan And heres the plan Firstcut the cost of prescription drugs Just look at insulin One in ten Americans has diabetes In Virginia I met a 13yearold boy named Joshua Davis He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes which means they need insulin every day Insulin costs about 10 a vial to make But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times more I spoke with Joshuas mom Imagine what its like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how youre going to pay for it What it does to your dignity your ability to look your child in the eye to be the parent you expect to be Joshua is here with us tonight Yesterday was his birthday Happy birthday buddy For Joshua and for the 200000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes lets cap the cost of insulin at 35 a month so everyone can afford it Drug companies will still do very well And while were at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs like the VA already does Look the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save 2400 a year on their health care premiums Lets close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent Secondcut energy costs for families an average of 500 a year by combatting climate change Lets provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit Double Americas clean energy production in solar wind and so much more Lower the price of electric vehicles saving you another 80 a month because youll never have to pay at the gas pump again Thirdcut the cost of child care Many families pay up to 14000 a year for child care per child Middleclass and working families shouldnt have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for care of young children My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldnt afford child care to be able to get back to work My plan doesnt stop there It also includes home and longterm care More affordable housing And PreK for every 3 and 4yearold All of these will lower costs And under my plan nobody earning less than 400000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes Nobody The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair We have to fix it Im not looking to punish anyone But lets make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share Just last year 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned 40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax Thats simply not fair Thats why Ive proposed a 15percent minimum tax rate for corporations We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies cant get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas Thats why Ive proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy dont pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter So thats my plan It will grow the economy and lower costs for families So what are we waiting for Lets get this done And while youre at it confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve which plays a critical role in fighting inflation My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot it will lower the deficit The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted But in my administration the watchdogs have been welcomed back Were going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans And tonight Im announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud By the end of this year the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition Im a capitalist but capitalism without competition isnt capitalism Its exploitationand it drives up prices When corporations dont have to compete their profits go up your prices go up and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America During the pandemic these foreignowned companies raised prices by as much as 1000 percent and made record profits Tonight Im announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up That ends on my watch Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect Well also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot provide more training and apprenticeships hire them based on their skills not degrees Lets pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave Raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit so no one has to raise a family in poverty Lets increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs and invest in what Jillour First Lady who teaches fulltimecalls Americas bestkept secret community colleges And lets pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a unionthey shouldnt be stopped When we invest in our workers when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together we can do something we havent done in a long time build a better America For more than two years COVID19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation And I know youre tired frustrated and exhausted But I also know this Because of the progress weve made because of your resilience and the tools we have tonight I can say we are moving forward safely back to more normal routines Weve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID19 with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July Just a few days ago the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe CDCissued new mask guidelines Under these new guidelines most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free And based on the projections more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks Thanks to the progress we have made this past year COVID19 need no longer control our lives I know some are talking about living with COVID19 Tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID19 We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads we will stay on guard Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely First stay protected with vaccines and treatments We know how incredibly effective vaccines are If youre vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans Now I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children The scientists are working hard to get that done and well be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do Were also ready with antiviral treatments If you get COVID19 the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent Weve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month And were launching the Test to Treat initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and if theyre positive receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost If youre immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability we have treatments and free highquality masks Were leaving no one behind or ignoring anyones needs as we move forward And on testing we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free Even if you already ordered free tests tonight I am announcing that you can order more from covidtestsgov starting next week Secondwe must prepare for new variants Over the past year weve gotten much better at detecting new variants If necessary well be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years And if Congress provides the funds we need well have new stockpiles of tests masks and pills ready if needed I cannot promise a new variant wont come But I can promise you well do everything within our power to be ready if it does Thirdwe can end the shutdown of schools and businesses We have the tools we need Its time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office Were doing that here in the federal government The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person Our schools are open Lets keep it that way Our kids need to be in school And with 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent most Americans can remove their masks return to work stay in the classroom and move forward safely We achieved this because we provided free vaccines treatments tests and masks Of course continuing this costs money I will soon send Congress a request The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again so I expect Congress to pass it quickly Fourth we will continue vaccinating the world Weve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries more than any other nation And we wont stop We have lost so much to COVID19 Time with one another And worst of all so much loss of life Lets use this moment to reset Lets stop looking at COVID19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is A Godawful disease Lets stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we really are Fellow Americans We cant change how divided weve been But we can change how we move forwardon COVID19 and other issues we must face together I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner Officer Jason Rivera They were responding to a 911 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun Officer Mora was 27 years old Officer Rivera was 22 Both Dominican Americans whod grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves Ive worked on these issues a long time I know what works Investing in crime prevention and community police officers wholl walk the beat wholl know the neighborhood and who can restore trust and safety So lets not abandon our streets Or choose between safety and equal justice Lets come together to protect our communities restore trust and hold law enforcement accountable Thats why the Justice Department required body cameras banned chokeholds and restricted noknock warrants for its officers Thats why the American Rescue Plan provided 350 billion that cities states and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruptiontrusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope We should all agree The answer is not to Defund the police The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities I ask Democrats and Republicans alike Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at homethey have no serial numbers and cant be traced And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence Pass universal background checks Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon Ban assault weapons and highcapacity magazines Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that cant be sued These laws dont infringe on the Second Amendment They save lives The most fundamental right in America is the right to voteand to have it counted And its under assault In state after state new laws have been passed not only to suppress the vote but to subvert entire elections We cannot let this happen Tonight I call on the Senate to Pass the Freedom to Vote Act Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act And while youre at it pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections Tonight Id like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran Constitutional scholar and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court Justice Breyer thank you for your service One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court And I did that 4 days ago when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson One of our nations top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyers legacy of excellence A former top litigator in private practice A former federal public defender And from a family of publicschool educators and police officers A consensus builder Since shes been nominated shes received a broad range of supportfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans And if we are to advance liberty and justice we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system We can do both At our border weve installed new technology like cuttingedge scanners to better detect drug smuggling Weve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers Were putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster Were securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this landmy forefathers and so many of yours Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers those on temporary status farm workers and essential workers Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families dont wait decades to reunite Its not only the right thing to doits the economically smart thing to do Thats why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the US Chamber of Commerce Lets get it done once and for all Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v Wadestanding precedent for half a centuryis under attack as never before If we want to go forwardnot backwardwe must protect access to health care Preserve a womans right to choose And lets continue to advance maternal health care in America And for our LGBTQ Americans lets finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong As I said last year especially to our younger transgender Americans I will always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach your Godgiven potential While it often appears that we never agree that isnt true I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year From preventing government shutdowns to protecting AsianAmericans from stilltoocommon hate crimes to reforming military justice And soon well strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things So tonight Im offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation Four big things we can do together First beat the opioid epidemic There is so much we can do Increase funding for prevention treatment harm reduction and recovery Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers If youre suffering from addiction know you are not alone I believe in recovery and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery Second lets take on mental health Especially among our children whose lives and education have been turned upside down The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that And we can all play a partsign up to be a tutor or a mentor Children were also struggling before the pandemic Bullying violence trauma and the harms of social media As Frances Haugen who is here with us tonight has shown we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment theyre conducting on our children for profit Its time to strengthen privacy protections ban targeted advertising to children demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children And lets get all Americans the mental health services they need More people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care Third support our veterans Veterans are the best of us Ive always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing and now helping lowerincome veterans get VA care debtfree Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits that incinerated wastes of warmedical and hazard material jet fuel and more When they came home many of the worlds fittest and best trained warriors were never the same Headaches Numbness Dizziness A cancer that would put them in a flagdraped coffin I know One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden We dont know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops But Im committed to finding out everything we can Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson He was born a soldier Army National Guard Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq Stationed near Baghdad just yards from burn pits the size of football fields Heaths widow Danielle is here with us tonight They loved going to Ohio State football games He loved building Legos with their daughter But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heaths lungs and body Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end He didnt know how to stop fighting and neither did she Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better Tonight Daniellewe are The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases already helping more veterans get benefits And tonight Im announcing were expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers Im also calling on Congress pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve And fourth lets end cancer as we know it This is personal to me and Jill to Kamala and to so many of you Cancer is the 2 cause of death in Americasecond only to heart disease Last month I announced our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases More support for patients and families To get there I call on Congress to fund ARPAH the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health Its based on DARPAthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet GPS and so much more ARPAH will have a singular purposeto drive breakthroughs in cancer Alzheimers diabetes and more A unity agenda for the nation We can do this My fellow Americanstonight we have gathered in a sacred spacethe citadel of our democracy In this Capitol generation after generation Americans have debated great questions amid great strife and have done great things We have fought for freedom expanded liberty defeated totalitarianism and terror And built the strongest freest and most prosperous nation the world has ever known Now is the hour Our moment of responsibility Our test of resolve and conscience of history itself It is in this moment that our character is formed Our purpose is found Our future is forged Well I know this nation We will meet the test To protect freedom and liberty to expand fairness and opportunity We will save democracy As hard as these times have been I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life Because I see the future that is within our grasp Because I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity The only nation that can be defined by a single word possibilities So on this night in our 245th year as a nation I have come to report on the State of the Union And my report is this the State of the Union is strongbecause you the American people are strong We are stronger today than we were a year ago And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today Now is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time And we will as one people One America The United States of America May God bless you all May God protect our troops
"February 24, 2022: Remarks on the Russian Invasion of Ukraine",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/february-24-2022-remarks-russian-invasion-ukraine,Joe Biden,2022-02-24,"President Biden gives a statement after President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered the invasion of the country of Ukraine. As Russian troops moved into Ukraine, the United States and its European and NATO allies responded with economic sanctions against Russia. Biden stresses the unity among NATO countries and the fight against oppression and invasion, standing up for freedom and democracy.",THE PRESIDENT Sorry to keep you waiting Good afternoon The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation without justification without necessityThis is a premeditated attack Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months as Ive beenas weve been saying all along He moved more than 175000 troops military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian borderHe moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all alongHe rejected every goodfaith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human sufferingFor weeksfor weeks we have been warning that this would happen And now its unfolding largely as we predictedIn the past week weve seen shelling increase in the Donbas the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russianbacked separatistsRusthe Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against UkraineWe saw a staged political theater in Moscowoutlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine wasUkraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons that Ukraine committed a genocidewithout any evidenceWe saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new socalled republics on sovereign Ukrainian territoryAnd at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraines sovereignty to stave off invasion Putin declared his warWithin momentsmoments missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across UkraineThen came in the air raids followed by tanks and troops rolling inWeve been transparent with the world Weve shared declassified evidence about Russias plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or coverup about what Putin was doingPutin is the aggressor Putin chose this war And now he and his country will bear the consequencesToday Im authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to RussiaThis is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over timeWe have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the longterm impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies And I want to be clear The United States is not doing this alone For months weve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economyTwentyseven members of the European Union including France Germany Italyas well as the United Kingdom Canada Japan Australia New Zealand and many othersto amplify the joint impact of our responseI just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning and we are in full and total agreement We will limit Russias ability to do business in Dollars Euros Pounds and Yen to be part of the global economy We will limit their ability to do that We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rusthe Russian militaryWere going to impose majorand were going to impair their ability to compete in a hightech 21st century economyWeve already seen the impact of our actions on Russias currency the Ruble which early today hit its weakest level everever in history And the Russian stock market plunged today The Russian governments borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percentIn todays actions we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around 1 trillion in assetsWeve cut off Russias largest banka bank that holds more than one third of Russias banking assets by itselfcut it off from the US financial system And today were also blocking four more major banks That means every asset they have in America will be frozen This includes VTB the secondlargest bank in Russia which has 250 billion in assetsAs promised were also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioningthat were sanctioning as wellAs I said on Tuesday these are people who personally gain from the Kremlins policies and they should share in the pain We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days aheadOn Tuesday we stopped the Russian government from raising money from US or European investorsNow were going to apply the same restrictions to Russias largest stateowned enterprisescompanies with assets that exceed 14 trillionSome of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russias access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to comeBetween our actions and those of our Allies and partners we estimate that well cut off more than half of Russias hightech importsIt will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military Itll degrade their aerospace industry including their space program It will hurt their ability to build ships reducing their ability to compete economically And it will be a major hit to Putins longterm strategic ambitions And were preparing to do more In addition to the economic penalties were imposing were also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies particularly in the eastTomorrow NATO will convene a summitwell be thereto bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO AllianceAlthough we provided over 650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this yearthis last year let me say it again Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the eastAs I made crystal clear the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power And the good news is NATO is more united and more determined than everThere is no doubtno doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments which says that an attack on one is an attack on allOver the past few weeks I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATOOn Tuesday in response to Russias aggressive action including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea Ive authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATOs eastern flank Allies Estonia Latvia Lithuania Poland and RomaniaOur Allies have also been stepping up addingthe other Allies the rest of NATOadding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defenseAnd today within hours of Russias unleashing its assault NATO came together and authorized and activatedan activation of response plansThis will enable NATOs highreadiness forces to deploy andwhen and where theyre needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of EuropeAnd now Im authorizing additional US forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATOs response including some of USbased forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks agoIve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Milley about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the worldNATOAs we respond my administration is using the toolsevery tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pumpYou know were taking active steps to bring down the costs And American oil and gas companies should notshould not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profitsYou know in our sanctions package we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continueWe are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy suppliesWe are actively working with countries around the world to elevate evaluate a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energyconsuming countries And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrantI know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump This is critical to meBut this aggression cannot go unanswered If it did the consequences for America would be much worse America stands up to bullies We stand up for freedom This is who we areLet me also repeat the warning I made last week If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies our critical infrastructure we are prepared to respondFor months we have been working closely with our privatewith the private sector to harden their cyber defenses sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as wellI spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States together with our Allies and partners in Europe will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country Well provide humanitarian relief to ease their sufferingAnd in the early days of this conflict Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a madeup threatBut history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations acts of mass civilmass civil disobedience and strategic deadendsThe next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine Putin has unleashed a great pain on them But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwardsThis is a dangerous moment for all of Europe for the freedom around the world Putin has ahas committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peaceBut now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlinand his Kremlin allies are really all about This was never about genuine security concerns on their part It was always about naked aggression about Putins desire for empire by any means necessaryby bullying Russias neighbors through coercion and corruption by changing borders by force and ultimately by choosing a war without a causePutins actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our worldone where nations take what they want by forceBut it is a vision that the United States and freedomloving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable powerThe United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger more united more determined and more purposefulAnd Putins aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearlyeconomically and strategically We will make sure of that Putin will be a pariah on the international stage Any nation that countenances Russias naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by associationWhen the history of this era is written Putins choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world strongerLiberty democracy human dignitythese are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies They cannot be erased by peoplefrom peoples hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation They endure And in the contest between democracy and autocracy between sovereignty and subjugation make no mistake Freedom will prevailGod bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine And may God protect our troopsQ President Biden THE PRESIDENT Associated Press ZekeQ Chris Megerian So do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point And what interactions have you had with the Russian governmentTHE PRESIDENT I heard the first part Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point And whatQ What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military inaudible in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflictTHE PRESIDENT Well its a large conflict already The way were going to assure its not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO NATO is more united than its ever been And I have no plans to talk with Putin Wall Street Journal Tarina TariniQ Mr President you didnt mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced Is there a reason why the US isnt doing that Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of itTHE PRESIDENT The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequencemaybe more consequence than SWIFTnumber one Number two it is always an option But right now thats not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take Cecilia VeVega ABC Q Thank you sir Sir sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point What is going to stop him How and when does this end And do you see him trying to go beyond UkraineAnd a second question Ill just give to you now This statement that he gave last night willthat the Wethe threat that he gavethe West will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history Is he threatening a nuclear strikeTHE PRESIDENT I have no idea what hes threatening I know what he has done number one And number two no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening That has to shthis is going to take time And we have to show resolve so he knows whats coming and so the people of Russia know what hes brought on them Thats what this is all about This is going to take time Its not going to occurhes going to say Oh my God these sanctions are coming Im going to stand down Hes going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together And we will We will and it will impose significant costs on him Q Will he go beyond Ukraine sir Do you see him going beyond UkraineQ Mr PresidentMr President THE PRESIDENT Points to reporter YesQ Thank you Two topics just really quick First markets are down and gas prices are up I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain How economically painful is it going to get for people in this countryAnd I do have one more question THE PRESIDENT First of all theres no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world So theres no doubt about that number oneNumber two the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions were going to impose on Russia period Whats your next question Im sorryQ The next question is Did you underestimate Putin And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer as a worthy adversaryTHE PRESIDENT At the time he wasI made it clear he was an adversary and I said he was worthy I didnt underestimate him And Ive read most of everything hes written Did you read theI shouldnt saIm not being a wise guy Theyou heard the speech he madealmost an hours worth of speecheswhy he was going into Ukraine He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine He wants to in fact reestablish the former Soviet Union Thats what this is about And I think that hishis ambitions areare completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrivedQ President BidenPresident Biden Q Andand with thatwith his ambitions youre confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanksTHE PRESIDENT Yes Russian bullets missiles and tanks in Ukraine Yes I amQ Thank you President Biden If sanctions cannot stop President Putin what penalty canTHE PRESIDENT I didnt say sanctions couldnt stop himQ But youve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now THE PRESIDENT Yes but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different thingsQ Okay but THE PRESIDENT Theyre two different things And were now going tohes going to begin to see the effect of the sanctionsQ And what will that dohow will that change his mindset here given hes attacking Ukraine as we speakTHE PRESIDENT Because it will so weaken his country that hell have to make a very very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a secondrate power or in fact respondQ You said in recent weeks that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table Is that a step that youre prepared to take And if not THE PRESIDENT Its not a bluff its on the tableQ Sanctioning President PutinTHE PRESIDENT YesQ Why not sanction him today sir Why not sanction him today sirQ Mr President Q Mr President if I can you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time but given the fullscale invasion given that youre not pursuing disconnecting Russia from whats called SWIFTthe international banking systemor other sanctions at your disposal respectfully sir what more are you waiting forTHE PRESIDENT Specifically the sanctions weve imposed exceed SWIFT The sanctions we imposed exceed anything thats ever been done The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us They are profound sanctions Lets have a conversation in another month or so to see if theyre workingYesQ Let me ask you aboutcan I ask you about Zelenskyy Sir you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday sir if I could follow up Q Whats the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War And is there now a complete rupture in US and Russian relationsTHE PRESIDENT There is a complete rupture right now in USRussian relations if they continue on this path that theyre onAnd in terms of a Cold War that depends You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what hes doingfrom Asia to South America to Europe to acraround the world And so its going to be a cold day for Russia The ideayou dont see a whole lot of people coming to his defenseQ And are youare youif I could followup sir Are you urging China to help isolate Russia Are you urging China to help isolate RussiaTHE PRESIDENT Im not prepared to comment on that at the momentQ Mr President THE PRESIDENT Wait No no Points to reporter YeahNo no no Hes had his hand up a long timeQ Thank you Mr President How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the US will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countriesTHE PRESIDENT Well if he did move into NATO countries he will be involvedwe will be involved The only thing that Im convinced of is If we dont stop now hell be emboldened If we dont move against him now with these significant sanctions he will be emboldenedLook you know everywell anywayQ And can you talk anything more about your conversation THE PRESIDENT Im sorry I cant hear youQ Sir India which is a major defense partner of the United

"January 6, 2022: Remarks on the Anniversary of the January 6th Assault on the US Capitol",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/january-6-2022-remarks-anniversary-january-6th-assault-us,Joe Biden,2022-01-06,"Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden make remarks on the first anniversary of the violent assault on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Both remember the violence that took place that day in the halls of the US Capitol as senators, representatives, and staff hid from those intent on harm while the Capitol Police and the DC Metropolitan Police Department tried to protect them. They also challenge Americans to protect our Constitution and our Democracy by rejecting lies and relying on the truth. President Biden remarks, ""it’s up to all of us—to 'We the People'—to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.""",VICE PRESIDENT Fellow Americans good morningCertain dates echo throughout history including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through themwhere they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars but a place in our collective memory December 7th 1941 September 11th 2001 And January 6th 2021On that day I was not only Vice Presidentelect I was also a United States senator And I was here at the Capitol that morning at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee Hours later the gates of the Capitol were breachedI had left But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues but to my staff who had been forced to seek refuge in our office converting filing cabinets into barricadesWhat the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building hallowed as it is What they were assaulting were the institutions the values the ideals that generations of Americans have marched picketed and shed blood to establish and defendOn January 6th we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful The lawlessness the violence the chaosWhat was at stake then and now is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it by we the peopleall the peopleWe cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices overturning our votes and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old and deepWhen I meet with young people they often ask about the state of our democracy about January 6th And what I tell them is January 6th reflects the dual nature of democracyits fragility and its strengthYou see the strength of democracy is the rule of law The strength of democracy is the principle that everyone should be treated equally that elections should be free and fair that corruption should be given no quarter The strength of democracy is that it empowers the peopleAnd the fragility of democracy is this that if we are not vigilant if we do not defend it democracy simply will not stand it will falter and failThe violent assault that took place here the very fact of how close we came to an election overturnedthat reflects the fragility of democracyYet the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that nighttheir resolve not to yield but to certify the election their loyalty not to party or person but to the Constitution of the United Statesthat reflects its strengthAnd so of course does the heroism of the Capitol Police the DC Metropolitan Police Department the National Guard and other law enforcement officers who answered the call that day including those who later succumbed to wounds both visible and invisibleOur thoughts are with all of the families who have lost a loved oneYou know I wonder how will January 6th come to be remembered in the years aheadWill it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest greatest democracy in the world or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to comeThe American spirit is being testedThe answer to whether we will meet that test resides where it always has resided in our countrywith you the peopleAnd the work ahead will not be easy Here in this very building a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair electionLets be clear We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate and the American people must also do something moreWe cannot sit on the sidelines We must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterityThat is the preamble of the Constitution that President Biden and I swore an oath to uphold and defend And that is the enduring promise of the United States of AmericaMy fellow Americans it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment a leader whose lifes work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union President Joe BidenTHE PRESIDENT Madam Vice President my fellow Americans To state the obvious one year ago today in this sacred place democracy was attackedsimply attacked The will of the people was under assault The Constitutionour Constitutionfaced the gravest of threatsOutnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack the Capitol Police the DC Metropolitan Police Department the National Guard and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of lawOur democracy held We the people endured And we the people prevailedFor the first time in our history a president had not just lost an election he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the CapitolBut they failed They failedAnd on this day of remembrance we must make sure that such an attack never never happens againIm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War This ison this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois Abraham Lincoln sat at desk 191 Above himabove us over that door leading into the Rotundais a sculpture depicting Clio the muse of history In her hands an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber belowClio stood watch over this hall one year ago today as she has for more than 200 years She recorded what took place The real history The real facts The real truth The facts and the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyesThe Bible tells us that we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free We shall know the truthWell here is the Gods truth about January 6th 2021Close your eyes Go back to that day What do you see Rioters rampaging waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America to rip us apartEven during the Civil War that never ever happened But it happened here in 2021What else do you see A mob breaking windows kicking in doors breaching the Capitol American flags on poles being used as weapons as spears Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers dragged them sprayed them stomped on themOver 140 police officers were injuredWeve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened One officer called it quote a medmedieval battle and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in IraqTheyve repeatedly asked since that day How dare anyoneanyonediminish belittle or deny the hell they were put throughWe saw it with our own eyes Rioters menaced these halls threatening the life of the Speaker of the House literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of AmericaBut what did we not seeWe didnt see a former president who had just rallied the mob to attacksitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted lives at risk and the nations capital under siegeThis wasnt a group of tourists This was an armed insurrectionThey werent looking to uphold the will of the people They were looking to deny the will of the peopleThey were looking to upholdthey werent looking to uphold a free and fair election They were looking to overturn oneThey werent looking to save the cause of America They were looking to subvert the ConstitutionThis isnt about being bogged down in the past This is about making sure the past isnt buriedThats the only way forward Thats what great nations do They dont bury the truth they face up to it Sounds like hyperbole but thats the truth They face up to itWe are a great nationMy fellow Americans in life theres truth and tragically there are lieslies conceived and spread for profit and powerWe must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lieAnd here is the truth The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election Hes done so because he values power over principle because he sees his own interests as more important than his countrys interests and Americas interests and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our ConstitutionHe cant accept he lost even though thats what 93 United States senators his own Attorney General his own Vice President governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said He lostThats what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forwardHe has done what no president in American historythe history of this countryhas ever ever done He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American peopleWhile some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it trying to uphold the principles of that party too many others are transforming that party into something else They seem no longer to want to be the partythe party of Lincoln Eisenhower Reagan the BushesBut whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible Because if we have a shared belief in democracy then anything is possibleanythingAnd so at this moment we must decide What kind of nation are we going to beAre we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a normAre we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the peopleAre we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of liesWe cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by itThe Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election DayNovember 3rd 2020Think about that Is that what you thought Is that what you thought when you voted that day Taking part in an insurrection Is that what you thought you were doing Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and votingThe former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the peopleCan you think of a more twisted way to look at this countryto look at America I cannotHeres the truth The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this countryMore of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemicsome at greagreat risk to their lives They should be applauded not attackedRight now in state after state new laws are being writtennot to protect the vote but to deny it not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it not to strengthen or protect our democracy but because the former president lostInstead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections Its wrong Its undemocratic And frankly its unAmericanThe second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 cant be trustedThe truth is that no electionno election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully countedEvery legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejectedoften rejected by Republicanappointed judges including judges appointed by the former president himself from state courts to the United States Supreme CourtRecounts were undertaken in state after state GeorgiaGeorgia counted its results three times with one recount by handPhony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states None changed the results And in some of them the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightlySo lets speak plainly about what happened in 2020 Even before the first ballot was cast the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results He built his lie over months It wasnt based on any facts He was just looking for an excusea pretextto cover for the truthHes not just a former president Hes a defeated former presidentdefeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair electionThere is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate In fact in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken the former president failed to make his caseJust think about this The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rdthe elections for governor United States Senate the House of Representativeselections in which they closed the gap in the HouseThey challenge none of that The Presidents name was first then we went down the linegovernors senators House of Representatives Somehow those results were accurate on the same ballot but the presidential race was flawedAnd on the same ballot the same day cast by the same votersThe only difference The former President didnt lose those races he just lost the one that was his ownFinally the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nations true patriotsIs that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol destroying property literally defecating in the hallways rifling through desks of senators and representatives hunting down members of congress Patriots Not in my viewTo me the true patriots were the more than 150 million Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote and the heroes who defended this CapitolYou cant love your country only when you winYou cant obey the law only when its convenientYou cant be patriotic when you embrace and enable liesThose who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of Americaat American democracyThey didnt come here out of patriotism or principle They came here in ragenot in service of America but rather in service of one manThose who incited the mobthe real plotterswho were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the votersBut their plot was foiled CongressmenDemocrats and Republicansstayed Senators representatives staffthey finished their work the Constitution demanded They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domesticLook folks now its up to all of usto We the Peopleto stand for the rule of law to preserve the flame of democracy to keep the promise of America aliveThat promise is at risk targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy fear over hope personal gain over public goodMake no mistake about it Were living at an inflection point in historyBoth at home and abroad were engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few between the peoples right of selfdetermination and selfthe selfseeking autocrat From China to Russia and beyond theyre betting that democracys days are numbered Theyve actually told me democracy is too slow too bogged down by division to succeed in todays rapidly changing complicated worldAnd theyre bettingtheyre betting America will become more like them and less like us Theyre betting that America is a place for the autocrat the dictator the strongmanI do not believe that That is not who we are That is not who we have ever been And that is not who we should ever ever beOur Founding Fathers as imperfect as they were set in motion an experiment that changed the worldliterally changed the worldHere in America the people would rule power would be transferred peacefullynever at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gunAnd they committed to paper an idea that couldnt live up tothey couldnt live up to but an idea that couldnt be constrained Yes in America all people are created equalWe reject the view that if you succeed I fail if you get ahead I fall behind if I hold you down I somehow lift myself upThe former President who lies about this election and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American valuesThey want to rule or they will ruinruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord at Gettysburg at Omaha Beach Seneca Falls Selma Alabama Whatand what we were fighting for the right to vote the right to govern ourselves the right to determine our own destinyAnd with rights come responsibilities the responsibility to see each other as neighborsmaybe we disagree with that neighbor but theyre not an adversary the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case the responsibility to see that America is an ideaan idea that requires vigilant stewardshipAs we stand here todayone year since January 6th 2021the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place they have not abatedSo we have to be firm resolute and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote countedSome have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effortJill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick who lost his life the day after the attack and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans who lost his life defending this Capitol as wellWe think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that dayfrom those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs to reporters cafeteria workers custodial workers and their familiesDont kid yourself The pain and scars from that day run deepI said it many times and its no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th We are in a battle for the soul of America A battle that by the grace of God and the goodness and graciousand greatness of this nation we will winBelieve me I know how difficult democracy is And Im crystal clear about the threats America faces But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hopeFrom the death and destruction as the Vice President referenced in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascismFrom the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislationSo now let us step up write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair playI did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today but I will not shrink from it eitherI will stand in this breach I will defend this nation And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy We will make sure the will of the people is heard that the ballot prevails not violence that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferredI believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation not divide it to lift us up not tear us apart to be about usabout us not about meDeep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years agoof liberty freedom and equalityThis is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats Were a nation of laws of order not chaos of peace not violenceHere in America the people rule through the ballot and their will prevailsSo let us remember Together were one nation under God indivisible that today tomorrow and forever at our best we are the United States of AmericaGod bless you all May God protect our troops And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy

workers mach who did I leave out AUDIENCE MEMBERS InaudibleTHE PRESIDENT Laughs AUDIENCE MEMBER Inaudible THE PRESIDENT Pardon me AUDIENCE MEMBER Inaudible THE PRESIDENT And my wife is a member of a union the NEA Applause Im going to get in trouble Machinists so many more Look folks for too long weve talked about having the best economy in the world Weve talked about asserting American leadership around the world with the best and the safest roads railroads ports airports Here in Washington weve heard countless speeches and promises and white papers from experts But today were finally getting this done Applause So my message to the American people is this America is moving again and your life is going to change for the better If you live in one of the top if you live in one of the 10 million homes or your child attends one of the 400000 schools or childcare centers that still has lead pipes in them you face a clear and present danger to your childs health and your health now This law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the nations lead pipes and service lines applause so every American every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water And tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters are going to get work done in goodpaying jobs Folks as as we saw with remote learning remote working during the pandemic access to highspeed Internet is essential and access to water as essential as access to water and electricity This law is going to make highspeed Internet affordable and available everywhere everywhere in America urban suburban rural and create jobs laying down those broadband lines No parent no parent coughs excuse me no parent should have to sit in a parking lot at a fastfood restaurant again just so their child can use the Internet to do their homework Thats over Applause And folks if I visited your town Im sure youd be able to tell me and where you hold your breath as you cross the particular bridge or where the most dangerous intersection of your town is This law makes this the most significant investment in roads and bridges in the past 70 years It makes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and in public transit ever So what what that means is youre going to be safer and youre going to get there faster and were going to have a whole hell of a lot pollution less pollution in the air The bipartisan law will modernize our ports our airports our freight rail to make it easier for companies to get goods to market reduce supply chain bottlenecks as were experiencing now and lower cost for you and your family The law also builds on our resilience so that the next storm superstorm drought wildfire hurricane can be dealt with Last year alone the United States as a consequence of these kind of extreme weather events lost 99 billion in the United States alone in damage After Hurricane Ida I see the distinguished governor from Louisiana is over there I saw him stand up I went down to see him We went through and saw all the damage there They had 179mileanhour winds at top speed in Louisiana But then I headed on up to New York Chuck up in your area into Queens and New Jersey More people died there than in a hurricane More people died with the flooding Record wildfires raged and went I went to Idaho and California and saw it More land has burned to the ground than the entire state of New Jersey out west Folks walk the neighborhoods and look the people in the eye in these circumstances as many of you have and youll see the despair and the heartache So many of you understand youre living through it This law builds back our bridges our water systems our powerlines our levees better and stronger so few Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power in those days and weeks that comes with the storms that hit Folks this bipartisan law for the first time ever creates a true national network of charging stations for electric vehicles over 500000 of them applause so you can charge your car here and drive all the way to California not worrying about having to find places to charge creating thousands of jobs thousands It is also going to make it possible for Americans to get off the sidelines and into the game of manufacturing solar panels wind turbines batteries to store energy and power for electric vehicles including electric school buses which will mean millions of children will no longer inhale the dangerous diesel fumes that come out of the buses Applause For real Its a big deal And itll reward companies for paying good wages and for buying American sourcing their products here in America right now Its going to help the United States export clean energy technologies to the world creating mil tens of thousands of more jobs Theres so much more in the law but most of all it does something truly historic I ran for President believing it was time to rebuild the backbone of this nation which I characterized as working people in the middle class theyre the ones who built the country and to rebuild the economy from the bottom up in the middle out This law delivers on that longoverdue promise in my view It creates better jobs for millions of Americans And no one no one earning less than 400000 a year will pay a single penny in federal taxes because of it Applause And it does not include as we did the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill it does not include a single penny in gas tax which I rejected because people under 400000 would be paying it This law is a bluecollar blueprint to rebuild America It leaves no one behind And it makes it marks an inflection point that we face as a nation For most of the 20th century we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves But somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves Weve risked losing our edge as a nation and China and the rest of the world are catching up Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world Now according to the World Economic Forum we rank 13th in the world Well thats about to change Applause Things are going to turn around in a big way For example because of this law next year will be the first year in 20 years American infrastructure investment will grow faster than Chinas Well once again have the best roads bridges ports and airports over the next decade And well lead the world into the 21st century with modern cars and trucks and transit systems Were going to do this by building again and moving again Folks too often in Washington the reason we didnt get things done is because we insisted on getting everything we want everything With this law we focus on getting things done I ran for President because the only way to move this country forward in my view was through compromise and consensus Thats how the system works Thats American democracy And Im going to be signing a law that is truly consequential because we made our democracy deliver for the American people We compromised We reached a consensus Thats necessary And now our focus moves to implementing an infrastructure law thats going to with speed and with discipline I have a lot of experience in doing that When I was Vice President I was given responsibility for overseeing and implementing the Recovery Act a nearly 900 billion emergency package Im proud to say that when we finished implementing that Recovery Act it was determined that there had been less than two tenths of 1 percent waste fraud or abuse And I was it was how I learned and earned the nicknameSheriff Joe from President Obama Because I made it a point every single day for well over a year to stay on top of how the money was being used I spoke with over 160 mayors two three times sometimes And I spoke with county executives and every governor save one I wont mention that save one laughter she could see Alaska from her porch but monitor what were doing just how it was being done And it was one of the most efficient implementations of a major program in American history And now we owe it to the American people to do the same thing again And to make sure every penny is spent where its supposed to go in a timely fashion Ive asked the former Mayor of New Orleans and former Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana Mitch Landrieu to oversee this responsibility Applause Hell have full access to every tool the federal government has to get it done And we have we have the high obligation and responsibility to make sure this money is used wisely and used well Folks Ive been looking forward to this day for a long time like all of my colleagues here have Tomorrow Ill be traveling to New Hampshire to visit a bridge that is structurally not safe like thousands of bridges across America Thats what this law is all about keeping communities safer and more efficient On Wednesday Ill be in Detroit to meet with the UAW workers who are building the next generation of electric vehicles And thats just the beginning Were also seeing me and the Vice youll be seeing me and the Vice President Harris Jill and Doug Cabinet officials hitting the road to help you understand how this is going to transform your lives for the better And folks when you see those projects start in your hometowns I want you to feel what I feel pride pride in what we can do together as the United States of America Folks you know the same goes for my plan to build back better for the people getting folks back to work and reducing costs of things like childcare eldercare housing healthcare prescription drugs and meeting the moment on climate change Im confident that the House will pass this bill and then were going to have to pass it in the Senate And its fully paid for It will reduce the deficit over the long term according to leading economists in the world And again no one earning less than 400000 will pay a single penny more in federal taxes And together together with the infrastructure bill millions of lives will be changed for the better Folks let me close with this Throughout our history weve emerged from crises by investing in ourselves During and after the Civil War its been referenced we built the transcontinental railroad uniting East and West and uniting America During the Cold War we built the Interstate Highway System transforming how America lived their lives And now were emerging from the COVID19 pandemic and well build an economy for the 21st century When I met with the President of China who Im going to be speaking with tonight several years ago he asked me we were in China he asked me he said Could I define America And I said Absolutely Its the Gods truth I said Absolutely I can define it in one word possibilities Possibilities There is no limit to what our people think we can do And there is no limit to what our nation can do And there is no one thing that I know more than this Its never ever been a good bet to bet against the American people Never never never Applause Given half a chance the American people have never ever ever ever let this nation down And its our job to give our people that chance Its our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibilities As I look out on this crowd today I see Democrats and Republicans national leaders local leaders all elected officials labor leaders business leaders and most of all I see fellow Americans I see America Lets remember this day Lets remember we can come together And most of all lets remember what we got done for the American people when we do come together I truly believe that 50 years from now historians are going to look back at this moment and say Thats the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century So with confidence optimism with vision and faith in each other lets believe in possibilities Lets believe in one another And lets believe in America God bless you all and may God protect our troops Applause Now let me sign this bipartisan bill Applause The bill is signed Applause Thank you thank you thank you Thanks everybody 421 PM EST
"September 9, 2021: Remarks on Fighting the COVID-⁠19 Pandemic",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/september-9-2021-remarks-fighting-covid-19-pandemic,Joe Biden,2021-09-09,"As the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus spreads and cases and deaths increase in the United States, President Joe Biden announces new efforts to fight the pandemic. He outlines six broad areas of action--implementing new vaccination requirements, protecting the vaccinated with booster shots, keeping children safe and schools open, increasing testing and masking, protecting our economic recovery, and improving care of those who do get Covid-19.",THE PRESIDENT Good evening my fellow Americans I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID19 the progress weve made and the work we have left to doAnd it starts with understanding this Even as the Delta variant 19 sic hasCOVID19has been hitting this country hard we have the tools to combat the virus if we can come together as a country and use those toolsIf we raise our vaccination rate protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing and identify people who are infected we can and we will turn the tide on COVID19It will take a lot of hard work and its going to take some time Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe effective and freeYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID19 So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID19 that Im going to be announcing tonight let me give you some clear information about where we standFirst we have conswe have made considerable progressin battling COVID19 When I became President about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated Today over 175 million Americans have that protection Before I took office we hadnt ordered enough vaccine for every American Just weeks in office we did The week before I took office on January 20th of this year over 25000 Americans died that week from COVID19 Last week that grim weekly toll was down 70 percentAnd in the three months before I took office our economy was faltering creating just 50000 jobs a month Were now averaging 700000 new jobs a month in the past three monthsThis progress is real But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office I need to tell you a second factWere in a tough stretch and it could last for a while The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before usWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated we read about we hear about and we see the stories of hospitalized people people on their death beds among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated And its caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80000 different locations we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot And to make matters worse there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID19 Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up theyre ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities This is totally unacceptableThird if you wonder how all this adds up heres the math The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot but one quarter has not gotten any Thats nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated And in a country as large as ours thats 25 percent minority That 25 percent can cause a lot of damageand they areThe unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreitis pancreatitis or cancerAnd fourth I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID19 I know theres a lot of confusion and misinformation But the worlds leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated your risk of severe illness from COVID19 is very low In fact based on available data from the summer only one of out of every 160000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per dayThese are the facts So heres where we stand The path ahead even with the Delta variant is not nearly as bad as last winter But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID19 and a distinct minority of Americans supported by a distinct minority of elected officialsare keeping us from turning the corner These pandemic politics as I refer to are making people sick causing unvaccinated people to die We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal As your President Im announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated to combat those blocking public health My plan also increases testing protects our economy and will make our kids safer in schools It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each thatand each of those actions that you can read more about at WhiteHousegov WhiteHousegovThe measuresthese are going to take time to have full impact But if we implement them I believe and the scientists indicate that in the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans decrease hospitalizations and deaths and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses openFirst we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administrationthe FDA Well last month the FDA granted that approvalSo the time for waiting is over This summer we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives as well as the FDA approval Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July But we need to do more This is not about freedom or personal choice Its about protecting yourself and those around youthe people you work with the people you care about the people you loveMy job as President is to protect all Americans So tonight Im announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a weekSome of the biggest companies are already requiring this United Airlines Disney Tysons Food and even Fox NewsThe bottom line Were going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers Were going to reduce the spread of COVID19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across AmericaMy plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the healthcare field Already Ive announced well be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid because I have that federal authorityTonight Im using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals home healthcare facilities or other medical facilitiesa total of 17 million healthcare workersIf youre seeking care at a health facility you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated Simple Straightforward PeriodNext I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinatedall And Ive signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the sameIf you want to work with the federal government and do business with us get vaccinated If you want to do business with the federal government vaccinate your workforce And tonight Im removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinatedThe Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinatedToday in total the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americanstwo thirds of all workers And for other sectors I issue this appeal To those of you running large entertainment venuesfrom sports arenas to concert venues to movie theatersplease require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entryAnd to the nations family physicians pediatricians GPsgeneral practitionersyoure the most trusted medical voice to your patients You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated Tonight Im asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot America needs your personal involvement in this critical effortAnd my message to unvaccinated Americans is this What more is there to wait for What more do you need to see Weve made vaccinations free safe and convenientThe vaccine has FDA approval Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot Weve been patient but our patience is wearing thin And your refusal has cost all of us So please do the right thing But just dont take it from me listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds taking their final breaths saying If only I had gotten vaccinated If onlyIts a tragedy Please dont let it become yoursThe second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinatedFor the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated I understand your anger at those who havent gotten vaccinated I understand the anxiety about getting a breakthrough caseBut as the science makes clear if youre fully vaccinated youre highly protected from severe illness even if you get COVID19 In fact recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5000 fully vaccinated Americans per dayYoure as safe as possible and were doing everything we can to keep it that waykeep it that way keep you safeThats where boosters come inthe shots that give you even more protection than after your second shotNow I know theres been some confusion about boosters So let me be clear Last month our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yetOf course the decision of which booster shots to give when to start them and who will give them will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease ControlBut while we wait weve done our part Weve bought enough boostersenough booster shotsand the distribution system is ready to administer themAs soon as they are authorized those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across thesites across the country for most Americans at your nearby drug store and for free The third piece of my plan is keepingand maybe the most importantis keeping our children safe and our schools open For any parent it doesnt matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild Trust me I know So let me speak to you directly Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worriesIt comes down to two separate categories children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligibleThe safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated They get vaccinated for a lot of things Thats it Get them vaccinatedAs with adults almost all the serious COVID19 cases were seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12 to 17yearoldsan age group that lags behind in vaccination ratesSo parents please get your teenager vaccinatedWhat about children under the age of 12 who cant get vaccinated yet Well the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home Every parent every teen sibling every caregiver around them should be vaccinated Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than the states with high vaccination rates Now if youre a parent of a young child youre wondering when will it bewhen will it bethe vaccine available for them I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12 We cant take shortcuts with that scientific work But Ive made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible and our nations top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can planNow to the schools We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measureslike testing masking adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for social distancing and vaccinationsthen children can be safe from COVID19 in schoolsToday about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated We should get that to 100 percent My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Departmentbecause I have the authority as President in the federal systemthe Defense Department and the Interior Departmentto get vaccinated Thats authority I possess Tonight Im announcing that well require all of nearly 300000 educators in the federal paid program Head Start program must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngestour youngestmost precious Americans and give parents the comfortAnd tonight Im calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff Some already have done so but we need more to step up Vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new They work Theyre overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children Ill always be on your side Let me be blunt My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions Right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs Talk about bullying in schools If theyll not helpif these governors wont help us beat the pandemic Ill use my power as President to get them out of the way The Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 percent I promise you I will have your back The fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking From the start America has failed to do enough COVID19 testing In order to better detect and control the Delta variant Im taking steps tonight to make testing more available more affordable and more convenient Ill use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests including those that you can use at home While that production is ramping up my administration has worked with top retailers like Walmart Amazon and Krogers and tonight were announcing that no later than next week each of these outlets will start to sell athome rapid test kits at cost for the next three months This is an immediate price reduction for athome test kits for up to 35 percent reductionWell also expandexpand free testing at 10000 pharmacies around the country And well commitwere committing 2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers food banks schools so that every American no matter their income can access free and convenient tests This is important to everyone particularly for a parent or a childwith a child not old enough to be vaccinated Youll be able to test them at home and test those around themIn addition to testing we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID19 Thats why when I came into office I required masks for all federal buildings and on federal lands on airlines and other modes of transportation Todaytonight Im announcing that the Transportation Safety Administrationthe TSAwill double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask If you break the rules be prepared to pay And by the way show some respect The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong its ugly The fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan which we passed early in my administration weve had record job creation for a new administration economic growth unmatched in 40 years We cannot let unvaccinated do this progressundo it turn it back So tonight Im announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery Well be expanding COVID19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs Thats a program thats going to allow small businesses to borrow up to 2 million from the current 500000 to keep going if COVID19 impacts on their sales These lowinterest longterm loans require no repayment for two years and be can used to hire and retain workers purchase inventory or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began Ill also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic Sixth were going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID19 In early July I announced the deployment of surge response teams These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services the CDC the Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management AgencyFEMAto areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID19 Since then the federal government has deployed nearly 1000 staff including doctors nurses paramedics into 18 states Today Im announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that theyll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country Additionally were increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors not conspirconspiracy theorists The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing sefesevere disease Weve already distributed 14 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals Tonight Im announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percentBefore I close let me say this Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus And as we continue to battle COVID19 we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response Well ensure that everyone is reached My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American including enough boosters for every American whos approved to get one We also know this virus transcends borders Thats why even as we execute this plan at home we need to continue fighting the virus overseas continue to be the arsenal of vaccines Were proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries more than all other countries combined including Europe China and Russia combined Thats American leadership on a global stage and thats just the beginningWeve also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccinesPfizer vaccinespurchased to donate to 100 lowerincome countries in need of vaccines And Ill be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this monthAs I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isnt caught flatfooted when a new pandemic comes againas it willnext month Im also going to release the plan in greater detailSo let me close with this We have soweve made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days Even so we remain at a critical moment a critical time We have the tools Now we just have to finish the job with truth with science with confidence and together as one nationLook were the United States of America Theres nothingnot a single thingwere unable to do if we do it together So lets stay togetherGod bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic And may God protect our troopsGet vaccinated
"August 26, 2021: Statement on Terror Attacks in Afghanistan",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/august-26-2021-statement-terror-attacks-afghanistan,Joe Biden,2021-08-26,"On August 26, 2021, a suicide bomber set off explosives at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing 13 US service members and dozens of Afghan civilians. The terrorist group, ISIS-K, later claimed responsibility for the attack. President Joe Biden responds to the situation by reiterating his commitment to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. In response to the attack, the president vows, ""We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay."" He then answers questions from the press.",THE PRESIDENT Been a tough day This evening in Kabul as you all know terrorists attackedthat weve been talking about and worried about that the intelligence community has assessed has was undertakenan attackby a group known as ISISKtook the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport and wounded several others seriously They also wounded a number of civilians and civilians were killed as wellIve been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington the Pentagon as well as in Afghanistan and Doha And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail and youve had a chance to speak to some so farThe situation on the ground is still evolving and Im constantly being updatedThese American service members who gave their livesits an overused word but its totally appropriatethey were heroes Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous selfless mission to save the lives of othersThey were part of an airlift an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history with more than 100000 American citizens American partners Afghans who helped us and others taken to safety in the last 11 days Just in the last 12 hours or so another 7000 have gotten outThey were part of the bravest most capable and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth And they were part of simply what I call the backbone of America Theyre the spine of America the best the country has to offerJill and Iour hearts ache like Im sure all of you do as well for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones including small children or been wounded in this vicious attack And were outraged as well as heartbrokenBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and before that was in Kosovo as a US attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a warwhen he came home after a year in Iraq he was diagnosed like many many coming home with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brainwho we lost We have some sense like many of you do what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today You get this feeling like youre being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest theres no way out My heart aches for youBut I know this We have a continuing obligation a sacred obligation to all of youthe families of those heroes That obligation is not temporary it lasts foreverThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty the service of security in the service of others in the service of AmericaLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism ofthe fallen this day theyre part of a great and noble company of American heroesTo those who carried out this attack as well as anyone who wishes America harm know this We will not forgive We will not forget We will hunt you down and make you pay I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my commandOver the past few weeksI know youremany of you are probably tired of hearing me say itweve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISISKan archenemy of the Taliban people who were freed when both those prisons were openedhas been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and othersThis is why from the outset Ive repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this missionAnd as General McKenzie said this is why our mission was designedthis is the way it was designed to operate operate under severe stress and attack Weve known that from the beginningAnd as Ive been in constant contact with our senior military leadersand I mean constant around the clockand our commanders on the ground and throughout the day they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission and we will And thats what Ive ordered them to doWe will not be deterred by terrorists We will not let them stop our mission We will continue the evacuationIve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISISK assets leadership and facilities We will respond with force and precision at our time at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing Here is what you need to know These ISIS terrorists will not win We will rescue the Americans who are there We will get out our Afghan allies out and our mission will go on America will not be intimidated I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans our partners our Afghan allies out of AfghanistanEvery day when I talk to our commanders I ask them what they needwhat more do they need if anything to get the job done As they will tell you I granted every request I reiterated to them again today on three occasions that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in KabulAnd I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon and all the commanders in the field There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectivesThose who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah when the Lord says Whom shall I sendwho shall go for us And the American military has been answering for a long time Here am I Lord Send me Here I am Send meEach one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harms way to risk everythingnot for glory not for profit but to defend what we love and the people we loveAnd I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniformmilitary and civilian who have given the last full measure of devotionA moment of silence is takenThank you May God bless you all And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America We have so much to do Its within our capacity to do it We just have to remain steadfast Steadfast We will complete our mission And we will continue after our troops have withdrawn to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan We will find them and we will get them out Ladies and gentlemen they gave me a list here The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly ODonnell of NBCQ Mr President you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States After todays attack do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan And are youare you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operationTHE PRESIDENT Ive instructed the military whatever they needif they need additional forceI will grant it But the militaryfrom the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs the Joint Chiefs the commanders in the fieldhave all contacted me one way or another usually by letter saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted That is the best way they believe to get as many Americans out as possible and others And with regard to finding tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this we have some reason to believe we know who they arenot certainand we will find ways of our choosing without large military operations to get themQ Inside Afghanistan Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT Wherever they areTrevor from ReutersQ Thank you Mr President There has been some criticism even from people in your party about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regardTHE PRESIDENT No I dont Look I think General McKenzie handled this question very well The fact is that were in a situationwe inherited a situation particularly since as we all know that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days beforein 11 daysthat it is in the interest of as Mackenzie said in the interest of the Taliban that in fact ISISK does not metastasize beyond what it is number one And number two its in their interest that we are able to leave on time on target As a consequence of that the major things weve asked themmoving back the perimeter give me more space between the wall stopping vehicles from coming through et cetera searching people coming throughit is not what youd call a tightly commanded regimented operation like the US isthe military isbut theyre acting in their interesttheir interestAnd so by and largeand Ive asked this same question to military on the ground whether or not its a useful exercise No one trusts them were just counting on their selfinterest to continue to generate their activities And its in their selfinterest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we canAnd like I said even in the midst of everything that happened today over 7000 people have gotten out over 5000 Americans overallSo its not a matter of trust its a matter of mutual selfinterest Andbut there is no evidence thus far that Ive been given as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue forbeyond todayAamer Associated PressQ Thank you Mr President You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions With that in mindand also what youve said that the longer we stay the more likelihood that there would be a major attackhow do you weigh staying even one more day considering whats happenedTHE PRESIDENT Because I think what America says matters What we say were going to do and the context in which we say were going to do it that we do itunless something exceptional changesThere are additional American citizens there are additional green card holders there are additional personnel of our allies there are additional SIV card holders there are additional Afghans that have helped us and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from womens groups to NGOs and others who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups on buses and other means that still presents the opportunity for the next several days between now and the 31st to be able to get them outAnd our militaryand I believe to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat knowing that we may very well have another attackthe military has concluded thats what we should do I think theyre right I think theyre correctAnd after that were going to be in a circumstance where there arewill be I believe numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan either through means that we provide andor are provided through cooperation with the Taliban Theyre not good guys the Taliban Im not suggesting that at all But they have a keen interest As many of you have been reporting they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open They dont have the capacity to do it They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust but fundamentally different than it had beenAnd so theres a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us but to others as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out We can locate themNow theres not many left that we can assess that arewant to come out Theres some Americans weve identifiedweve contacted the vast majority of them if not all of themwho dont want to leave because they have sigtheyre dual nationals they have extended families et cetera And theres others who are looking for the time So thats why we continueIll take a few more questions andbut you sirQ Thank you Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I didnt pick you but thats okay LaughsQ I wanted to ask youyou say that what America says matters What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops who may not be able to get out by August 31st What THE PRESIDENT I say Q What do you say to themTHE PRESIDENTwere going to continue to try to get you out It mattersLook I know of no conflict as a student of historyno conflict where when a war was ending one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out And think about it folks I think its important forI know the American people get this in their gut There are I would argue millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs who if given a chance theyd be onboard a plane tomorrow It sounds ridiculous but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America given a choiceSo getting every single person out iscant be guaranteed to anybody because theres a determination all who wants to get out as wellAt any rate its a processI was really pointing to you butyou sirQ Thank you Mr President There are reports that US officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate Were you aware of that Did that happenAnd then sir did you personally reject a recommendation to hold or to recapture Bagram Air Force BaseTHE PRESIDENT Heres what Ive done on theask thisIll answer the last question first On the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistanthe commanders as well as the Pentagon And I ask for their best military judgment what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the missionThey concludedthe militarythat Bagram was not much value added that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul And so I followed that recommendation With regard tothere are certain circumstances where weve gotten informationand quite frankly sometimes from some of yousaying You know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and theyre on a bus theyre movingfrom other peopleand this is their locationAnd there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said Thisfor example This bus is coming through with X number of people on it made up of the following group of people We want you to let that bus or that group through So yes there have been occasions like that And to the best of my knowledge in those cases the bulk of that has occurredtheyve been let through But I cant tell you with any certitude that theres actually been a list of names I dontthere may have been but I know of no circumstance It doesnt mean its notit didnt exist that Heres the names of 12 people theyre coming Let them through It could very well have happened Ill take one more questionQ Mr President can I Q Mr President right here Mr President THE PRESIDENT Whoa Wait wait wait Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press Q Thank you Mr President Is thatis therethank youTHE PRESIDENT Thats you LaughterQ Mr President there had not been a US service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020 You set a deadline You pulled troops out You sent troops back in And now 12 Marines are dead You said the buck stops with you Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeksTHE PRESIDENT I bear responsibility for fundamentally all thats happened of lateBut heres the deal You knowI wish youd one day say these thingsyou know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1In return the commitment was madeand that was a year beforein return he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others but would not attack any American forces Remember that Im being serious Q Mr President THE PRESIDENT No IIm asking you a question Be abecause before I Q Donald Trump is not the President right nowTHE PRESIDENT No nonow wait a minute Im asking you a question Is thatis that accurate to the best of your knowledgeQ I know what youre talking about But Mr President respectfullyTHE PRESIDENT WhatQsinceI dont think that the issue thatdo you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan or just the way that things have happened THE PRESIDENT I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurtsome as weve seen have gotten killedand that it is messyThe reason whywhether my friend will acknowledge it and wasreported itthe reason why there were no attacks on Americans as you said from the date until I came into office was because the commitment was made by President Trump I will be out by May 1st In the meantime you agree not to attack any Americans That was the deal Thats why no American was attackedQ And you said that you stilla few days ago you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull outTHE PRESIDENT Yes I do Because look at it this way folksand Im going toI have another meeting for real But imagine where wed be if I had indicated on May the 1st I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date we were going to stay thereId have only one alternative Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won relativeis why the reason we went in the first placeI have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistana country that has never once in its entire history been a united country and is made upand I dont mean this in a derogatorymade up of different tribes who have never ever ever gotten along with one anotherAnd so as I said beforeand this is the last comment Ill make but well have more chance to talk about this unfortunately beyond because were not out yetif Osama bin Laden as well as al Qaeda had chosen to launch an attackwhen they left Saudi Arabiaout of Yemen would we have ever gone to Afghanistan Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time would we have ever goneI know its not fair to ask you questions Its rhetorical But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of woundedOur interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemergingfirst to get bin Laden wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan and prevent that from happening againAs Ive said 100 times Terrorism has metastasized around the world we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States We dont have military encampments there we dont keep people there We have overthehorizon capability to keep them from going after us Ladies and gentlemen it was time to end a 20year warThank you so much
"August 16, 2021: Remarks on Situation in Afghanistan",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/august-16-2021-remarks-situation-afghanistan,Joe Biden,2021-08-16,"President Joe Biden defends his decision to pull out US troops from Afghanistan as the country fall to the Taliban. He argues that it is time for the US military to leave Afghanistan and to let the Afghan people run their country. He acknowledges how painful the situation is after twenty years of US involvement, but stands by his decision.",THE PRESIDENT Good afternoon I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps were taking to address the rapidly evolving eventsMy national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency includingand contingencyincluding the rapid collapse were seeing nowIll speak more in a moment about the specific steps were taking but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what Americas interests are in AfghanistanWe went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals get those who attacked us on September 11th 2001 and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us againWe did that We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden and we got him That was a decade ago Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building It was never supposed to be creating a unified centralized democracyOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been preventing a terrorist attack on American homelandIve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorismnot counterinsurgency or nation building Thats why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice PresidentAnd thats why as President I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021not yesterdays threatsToday the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan al Shabaab in Somalia al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula alNusra in Syria ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia These threats warrant our attention and our resourcesWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we dont have a permanent military presenceIf necessary we will do the same in Afghanistan Weve developed counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if neededWhen I came into office I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban Under his agreement US forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1 2021just a little over three months after I took officeUS forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15500 American forces to 2500 troops in country and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001The choice I had to make as your President was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting seasonThere would have been no ceasefire after May 1 There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1 There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan lurching into the third decade of conflict I stand squarely behind my decision After 20 years Ive learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forcesThats why we were still there We were cleareyed about the risks We planned for every contingencyBut I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you The truth is This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipatedSo whats happened Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country The Afghan military collapsed sometimes without trying to fightIf anything the developments of the past week reinforced that ending US military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves We spent over a trillion dollars We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300000 strongincredibly well equippeda force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies We gave them every tool they could need We paid their salaries provided for the maintenance of their air forcesomething the Taliban doesnt have Taliban does not have an air force We provided close air support We gave them every chance to determine their own future What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that futureTheres some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now there is no chance that 1 year1 more year 5 more years or 20 more years of US military boots on the ground wouldve made any differenceAnd heres what I believe to my core It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistans own armed forces would not If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down they would never have done so while US troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for themAnd our true strategic competitorsChina and Russiawould love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitelyWhen I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July we had very frank conversations We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the US military departed to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically They failed to do any of thatI also urged them to engage in diplomacy to seek a political settlement with the Taliban This advice was flatly refused Mr Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight but obviously he was wrongSo Im left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay How many more generations of Americas daughters and sons would you have me send to fight AfghansAfghanistans civil war when Afghan troops will not How many more livesAmerican livesis it worth How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National CemeteryIm clear on my answer I will not repeat the mistakes weve made in the pastthe mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of US forcesThose are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignoreI also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us The scenes were seeing in Afghanistan theyre gutwrenching particularly for our veterans our diplomats humanitarian workers for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan peopleFor those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the countryserve our country in Afghanistanthis is deeply deeply personalIt is for me as well Ive worked on these issues as long as anyone Ive been throughout Afghanistan during this warwhile the war was going onfrom Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar ValleyIve traveled there on four different occasions I met with the people Ive spoken to the leaders I spent time with our troops And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in AfghanistanSo now were fercus sicfocused on what is possible We will continue to support the Afghan people We will lead with our diplomacy our international influence and our humanitarian aidWell continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instabilityWell continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan peopleof women and girlsjust as we speak out all over the worldI have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy not the periphery But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments its with our diplomacy our economic tools and rallying the world to join us Now let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan I was asked to authorizeand I did6000 US troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of US and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of AfghanistanOur troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights Were taking over air traffic control We have safely shut down our embassy and transferred our diplomats Our dipour diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as wellOver the coming days we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in AfghanistanWell also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnelthe civilian personnel of our Allies who are still serving in AfghanistanOperation Allies Refugee Refuge which I announced back in July has already moved 2000 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their families to the United StatesIn the coming days the US military will provide assistance to move more SIVeligible Afghans and their families out of AfghanistanWere also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy US nongovernmental agenciesor the US nongovernmental organizations and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk and US news agenciesI know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghanscivilians sooner Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlierstill hopeful for their country And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering as they said a crisis of confidenceAmerican troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do but it is not without risksAs we carry out this departure we have made it clear to the Taliban If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation the US presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful We will defend our people with devastating force if necessaryOur current military mission will be short in time limited in scope and focused in its objectives Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible And once we have completed this mission we will conclude our military withdrawal We will end Americas longest war after 20 long years of bloodshedThe events were seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable united and secure Afghanistanas known in history as the graveyard of empiresWhat is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future We have to be honest Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many misstepsmade many missteps over the past two decades Im now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistantwo Democrats and two Republicans I will not pass this responsibly onresponsibility on to a fifth PresidentI will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from hereI am President of the United States of America and the buck stops with meI am deeply saddened by the facts we now face But I do not regret my decision to end Americas warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laserfocus on our counterterrorism missions there and in other parts of the worldOur mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden was a successOur decadeslong effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not and I wrote and believed it never could beI cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in anotherin another countrys civil war taking casualties suffering lifeshattering injuries leaving families broken by grief and lossThis is not in our national security interest It is not what the American people want It is not what our troops who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades deserveI made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring Americas military involvement in Afghanistan to an end And while its been hard and messyand yes far from perfectIve honored that commitmentMore importantly I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation that I wasnt going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man I will not do it in AfghanistanI know my decision will be criticized but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United Statesyet another onea fifth one Because its the right oneits the right decision for our people The right one for our brave service members who have risked their lives serving our nation And its the right one for America So thank you May God protect our troops our diplomats and all of the brave Americans serving in harms way
"July 8, 2021: Speech on the Drawdown of US Forces in Afghanistan",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/july-8-2021-speech-drawdown-us-forces-afghanistan,Joe Biden,2021-07-08,"President Joe Biden details his administration's decision to remove US forces from Afghanistan. He notes that ""it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely."" He believes that it is time for the Afghan people and leaders to come together to decide their future and how they want to run their country.",THE PRESIDENT Good afternoon Earlier today I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of US forces and allied forces in AfghanistanWhen I announced our drawdown in April I said we would be out by September and were on track to meet that targetOur military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way prioritizing the safety of our troops as they departOur military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown And in this context speed is safetyAnd thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal no oneno one US forces or any forces havehave been lost Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increased risk of safety to our personnelTo me those risks were unacceptable And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism Thats what they do And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supportedwe are supporting and supporting us as well as they conclude their retrogradeI want to be clear The US military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August We remainwe retain personnel and capacities in the country and we maintain some authorityexcuse me the same authority under which weve been operating for some timeAs I said in April the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 911 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States We achieved those objectives Thats why we wentWe did not go to Afghanistan to nationbuild And its the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their countryTogether with our NATO Allies and partners we have trained and equipped over three hunearly 300000 current serving members of the militaryof the Afghan National Security Force and many beyond that who are no longer serving Add to that hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decadesWe provided our Afghan partners with all the toolslet me emphasize all the tools training and equipment of any modern military We provided advanced weaponry And were going to continue to provide funding and equipment And well ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air forceBut most critically as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserveIn our meeting I also assured Ghani that US support for the people of Afghanistan will endure We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance including speaking out for the rights of women and girlsI intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airportAnd were going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violenceIve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solutionTo be clearto be clear Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement Well work with them and they should help step up their efforts as wellWere going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans including Markexcuse meFre FrerichsI want to pronounce the name correctly I misI misspokeso that he can return to his family safelyWere also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work sidebyside with US forces including interpreters and translatorssince were no longer going to have military there after this were not going to need them and they have no jobswho are also going to be vital to our efforts so theyand theyve been very vitaland so their families are not exposed to danger as wellWeve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United StatesSince I was inaugurated on January 20th weve already approved 2500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States Up to now fewer than half have exercised their right to do that Half have gotten on aircraft and comcommercial flights and come and the other half believe they want to stayat least thus farWere working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the US military mission concludes so that if they choose they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their US visas are being processedThe operation has identified US facilities outside of the continental United States as well as in third countries to host our Afghan allies if they chif they so choose And starting this month were going to begin to rererelocwere going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leaveWe have a point person in the White House and at the State Departmentled task force coordinating all these effortsBut our message to those women and men is clear There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose and we will stand with you just as you stood with usWhen I made the decision to end the US military involvement in Afghanistan I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely I made the decision with clear eyes and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updatesBut for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year I ask them to consider the lessons of recent historyIn 2011 the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014 In 2014 some argued One more year So we kept fighting and we kept taking casualties In 2015 the same And on and onNearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitelyIts up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their countryOthers are more direct Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghanin Afghanistan indefinitely In doing so they point to the fact that wewe have not taken losses in this last year so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimalBut that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office The Taliban was at its strongest milis at its strongest militarily since 2001The number of US forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum And the United States in the last administration made an agreement that thewith the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this pastof this year Thats what I inherited That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against US forcesIf in April I had instead announced that the United States was going to backgoing back on that agreement made by the last administrationthat the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable futurethe Taliban would have again begun to target our forcesThe status quo was not an option Staying would have meant US troops taking casualties American men and women back in the middle of a civil war And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troopsOnce that agreement with the Taliban had been made staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possibleSo let me ask those who wanted us to stay How many morehow many thousands more of Americas daughters and sons are you willing to risk How long would you have them stayAlready we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well Would you send your own son or daughterAfter 20 yearsa trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces 2448 Americans killed 20722 more wounded and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental healthI will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcomeThe United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago We need to meet the threats where they are todayToday the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan So we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher in South Asia the Middle East and AfricaBut make no mistake Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from AfghanistanWe are developing a counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and act quickly and decisively if neededAnd we also need to focus on shoring up Americas core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determinedetermine our futureWe have to defeat COVID19 at home and around the world make sure were better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threatWe need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergencemerging technologiesWe need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate changeAnd we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years not the last 20 yearsFinally I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the US military and civilian personnel serving alongside our Allies and partners have made over the last two decades in AfghanistanI want to honor the significance of what theyve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planetand Ive been almost throughout that entire country ensuring there hasnt been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years taking out Bin LadenI want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this warWell never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their countryWere ending Americas longest war but well always always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in itMay God bless you all and may God protect our troops Thank youQ Mr Presidentdo you trust the Taliban Mr PresidentQ Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitableTHE PRESIDENT No it is notQ WhyTHE PRESIDENT Because youthe Afghan troops have 300000 wellequippedas wellequipped as any army in the worldand an air force against something like 75000 Taliban It is not inevitableQ Do you trust the Taliban Mr President Do you trust the Taliban sirTHE PRESIDENT Youis that a serious questionQ It is absolutely a serious question Do you trust the TalibanTHE PRESIDENT No I do notQ Do you trust handing over the country to the TalibanTHE PRESIDENT No I do not trust the TalibanQ So why are you handing the country overQ Mr President is the US responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the countryQ Mr President will you amplify that question please Will you amplify your answer pleasewhy you dont trust the TalibanTHE PRESIDENT Its aits a silly question Do I trust the Taliban No But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military who is better trained better equipped and more remore competent in terms of conducting warYes maamQ Thank you Mr President Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost in your view with making this decision were the last 20 years worth itTHE PRESIDENT You know my record I can tell by the way you asked the questionI opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan I argued from the beginning as you may recallit came to light after the administration was over lastour administrationno nation has ever unified Afghanistan No nation Empires have gone there and not done itThe focus we hadand I strongly support itand you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden wasallegedly escaped orout of harms wayWe went for two reasons one to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell as I said at the time The second reason was to eliminate al Qaedas capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory We accomplished both of those objectivesperiodThats what I believed from the beginning why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan That job had been over for some time And thats why I believe that this is the right decision and quite frankly overdueQ Mr President has the civilian government hailed the people of AfghanistanQ Mr President thank you very much Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapseTHE PRESIDENT That is not trueQ Is itcan you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or notTHE PRESIDENT That is not true They did notthey didntdid not reach that conclusionQ So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapseTHE PRESIDENT The Afghan government and leadership has to come together They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place The question is Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it Its not a question of whether they have the capacity They have the capacity They have the forces They have the equipment The question is Will they do itAnd I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani that we are not going just suswalk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force We are Were going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things inin the region Butbut theres not a conclusion that in fact they cannot defeat the TalibanI believe the only way theres going to bethis is now Joe Biden not the intelligence communitythe only way theres ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peaceAnd the likelihood theres going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikelyQ Mr President thank you But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan General Scott Miller He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war So if Kabul falls to the Taliban what will the United States do about itTHE PRESIDENT Look youve said two thingsone that if it could result in a civil warthats different than the Taliban succeeding number one Number two the question of what will be done is going to be implicatedis going to implicate the entire region as well Theres a number of countries who have a grave concern about whats going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their securityThe question is How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement Thats when that judgement will be madeQ Mr President some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam with some people feeling THE PRESIDENT None whatsoever Zero What you had isyou had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassysix if Im not mistakenThe Taliban is not the souththe North Vietnamese army Theyre nottheyre not remotely comparable in terms of capability Theres going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in theof the United States from Afghanistan It is not at all comparableQ And Mr President Q Mr President can I THE PRESIDENT Ill take him and then Illand then Ill goIll go to the other side Hang on a secondQ Mr President how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing thereTHE PRESIDENT Well first of all the mission hasnt failed yet There is in Afghanistanin all parties theres been corruption The question is can there be an agreement on unity of purpose What is the objectiveFor example it started offthere were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government Thatthat ofit didnt come toit didnt come to fruitionSo the question now is where do they go from here Thatthe jury is still out But the likelihood theres going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikelyYes maamQ Mr President will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a THE PRESIDENT NoQmilitary exitTHE PRESIDENT No no no Its up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want not us to impose the government on them No country has ever been able to do thatKeep in mind as a student of history as Im sure you are never has Afghanistan been a united country not in all of its history Not in all of its historyQ Mr President if this isnt a mission accomplished moment what is it in your viewTHE PRESIDENT No theres no mission accomplishedQ How would you describe itTHE PRESIDENT The mission was accomplished in that we getgot Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the worldQ Mr President if speed is safety as you just said in your remarks are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction if it may not happen until next month at the endTHE PRESIDENT Well much of it has already happened Theres already been peopleabout a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come homecome to the United States already on commercial aircraft So as I said theres over 2500 people that asfrom January to now have gotten those visas And only half decided that they wanted to leaveThe point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up period in terms of being able to get these visasQ Why cant the US evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to doTHE PRESIDENT Because the law doesnt allow that to happen And thats why were asking the Congress to consider changing the lawBut in the meantime we can guarantee their safety if they wish to leave by taking them to third countries andor while the wait is taking place to come totoand hopefully while theyre waiting there to be able to bring them back to the United States if thats what they choose to doQ And what do you makeand what do you make sir of the Taliban being in Russia todayQ Mr President Im from Afghanistan I am Afghan inaudible woman Any messagegood message for Afghan women in future Because they have achievementthey are really concerned about their achievementTHE PRESIDENT They are very concerned with good reasonQ YesTHE PRESIDENT When I was in AfghanistanIve been there a number of timesI remember being in a school outside andand by the way the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast where they have you know aan area in the middle that is sort of likeit looks like a playground and singlestory buildings connected around itAnd I remember saying tospeaking to a group of young womenI guess they were roughlydont hold me to thisthey look like theyd be 14 15 years old And theyre in school and theres a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling as I know you knowAnd I said You know the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist Osama bin Laden and that terrorists didnt amass again toto go after our country And then were going to have to leave And a young woman said You cant leave You cant leave It wasit was heartbreaking You cant leave she said I want to be a doctor I want to be a doctor I want to be a doctor If you leave Ill never be able to be a doctor Well thats why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that If every work Well anywayso yes Im awareIm going to take one more questionQ Mr President have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawalQ Inaudible the Taliban being in Russia todaythe Taliban Q MrMr President Ithank you I wanted to ask With the benefit of hindsight youve spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that youve seen in 20 years How do you feel personally about that with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent thereTHE PRESIDENT Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police theyre not even close in terms of their capacityI was making the pointthe point was that here we were I wasthe argument is Well we could stay because no one was dying No Americans are being shot So why leave Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before Not more sophisticated than the ANSF the government More than they wereThe point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we werent going to go after them That was the point I was makingThank you all so very much Thank you

hundred years and the first President to be here during that entire time and in this place in this ground to acknowledge the truth of what took place hereFor much too long the history of what took place here was told in silence cloaked in darkness But just because history is silent it doesnt mean that it did not take place And while darkness can hide much it erases nothing It erases nothing Some injustices are so heinous so horrific so grievous they cant be buried no matter how hard people tryAnd so it is here Onlyonly with truth can come healing and justice and repair Only with truth facing it But that isnt enough First we have to see hear and give respect to Mother Randle Mother Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis Applause To all those lost so many years ago to all the descendants of those

wealth in culture and community and heritage Applause But one nightone night changed everything Everything changed While Greenwood was a community to itself it was not separated from the outsideIt wasnt everyone but there was enough hate resentment and vengeance in the community Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equalNative Americans Asian Americans Hispanic Americans Black Americans A belief enforced by law by badge by hood and by noose And it speaks to thatlit the fuse It lit it by the spark that it provideda fuse of furywas an innocent interaction that turned into an ina terrible terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenagerA white mob of 1000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held ready to do what still occurred lynch that young man that night But 75 Black men including Black veterans arrived to stand guard Words were exchanged Then a scuffle Then shots fired Hell was unleashed Literal hell was unleashed Through the night and into the morning the mob terrorized Greenwood Torches and guns Shooting at will A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside An elderly couple knelt by their bed praying to God with their heart and their soul when they were shot in the back of their headsPrivate planesprivate planesdropping explosivesthe first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an

she still sees Black bodies aroundThe Greenwood newspaper publisher AJ Smitherton sicexcuse meSmitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night And heres the poem He said Kill them burn them set the pace teach them how to keep their place Reign of murder theft and plunder was the order of the night Thats what he remembered in the poem that he wroteOne hundred years ago at this hour on this first day of June smoke darkened the Tulsa sky rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember razed and in rubbleLess than 24 hoursin less than 24 hours 1100 Black homes and businesses were lost Insurance companiesthey had insurance many of themrejected claims of damage Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless placed in internment campsAs I was told today they were told Dont you mention you were ever in a camp or well come and get you Thats what survivors told meYet no oneno arrests of the mob were made None No proper accounting of the dead The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people Thats all Thirtysix peopleBut based on studies records and accounts the likelihoodthe likely number is much more in the multiple of hundreds Untold bodies dumped into mass graves Families who at the time waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closureBut you know as we speak the processthe process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started And at this moment Id like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers the mothers the sisters sons and daughters friends of God and Greenwood They deserve dignity and they deserve our respect May their souls rest in peacePause for a moment of silenceMy fellow Americans this was not a riot This was a massacreapplauseamong the worst in our history but not the only one And for too long forgotten by our historyAs soon as it happened there was a clear effort to erase it from our memoryour collective memoriesfrom the news and everyday conversations For a long time schools in Tulsa didnt even teach it let alone schools elsewhereAnd most people didnt realize that a century ago a second Ku Klux Klan had been foundedthe second Ku Klux Klan had been foundedA friend of mine Jon MeachamI had writtenwhen I said I was running to restore the soul of America he wrote a book called The Soul of Americanot because of what I said And theres a picture about page 160 in his book showing over 30000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia Reverendpointed hats the robesmarching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC Jesse you know all about this WashinWashington DCIf my memory is correct there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan There were five if Im not mistakenit could have been seven I think it was fivemembers of the United States Senateopen members of the Klan Multiple governors who were open members of the KlanMost people didnt realize that a century ago the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me who were Catholic It wasnt about African Americans then it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute ChristianityThe flames from those burning crosses torched every regionregion of the country Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan and they werent even embarrassed by it they were proud of itAnd that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesnt impact us today because it does still impact us todayWe cant just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know Applause We should know the good the bad everything Thats what great nations do They come to terms with their dark sides And were a great nationThe only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild I come here to help fill the silence because in silence wounds deepen Applause And onlyas painful as it is only in remembrance do wounds heal We just have to choose to rememberWe memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be so it cant be erased We know here in this hallowed place we simply cant bury pain and trauma foreverAnd at some point there will be a reckoning an inflection point like were facing right now as a nationWhat many people hadnt seen before or haor simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer You see it in so many places And theres greater recognition that for too long weve allowed a narrowed cramped view of the promise of this nation to festerthe view that America is a zerosum game where there is only one winner If you succeed I fail If you get ahead I fall behind If you get a job I lose mine And maybe worst of all If I hold you down I lift myself up instead of If you do well we all do well Applause We see that in GreenwoodThis story isnt about the loss of life but a loss of living of wealth and prosterity prosperity and possibilities that still reverberates todayMother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards as a domestic workerMr Van Ellis has shared how even after enlisting and serving in World War Two he still came home to struggle with a segregated AmericaImagine all those hotels and dinners diners and momandpop shops that could beenhave been passed down this past hundred years Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood financial security and generational wealthIf you come from backgrounds like mymy familya workingclass middleclass familythe only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes Imagine what they contributed then and what they couldve contributed all these years Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years what that wouldve meant for all of Tulsa including the white communityWhile the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre it didnt last Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships Applause A highway was built right through the heart of the community Lisa I was talking about our west sidewhat 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military after Dr King was murdered The communitycutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding ApplauseWe must find the courage to change the things we know we can change Thats what Vice President Harris and I are focused on along with our entire administration including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge who is here today ApplauseBecause today were announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community The first is My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family ApplauseAnd I might addand I need help if you have an answer to this I cant figure this one out Congressman Horsford But if you live in a Black community and theres another one on the other side of the highwayits a white community its thebuilt by the same builder and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community yourecan pay more for your auto insurance Shockingly the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago Lower today Thats wrong And were committing to changing thatJust imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into thatinto that home and provide for their familiesSecond small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities As President my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers to installing railings in federal buildings to professional servicesWe have a thing calledI wont go into it all because theres not enough time now But Im determined to use every taxpayers dollar that is assigned to me to spend going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri to build American products And as part of that Im going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small disadvantaged businesses including Black and brown small businessesRight now it calls for 10 percent Im going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent inaudible Applause I have the authority to do that Just imagine if instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communitiesThatthe data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding given the chance as white entrepreneurs are But they dont have lawyers They dont havetheythey dont have accountants but they have great ideas Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make And I promise you thats why I set up thea national Small Business Administration thats much broader Because theyre going to get those loans Instead of consigning millions of American children to underresourced schools lets give each and every child three and four years old access to schoolnot daycare school ApplauseIn the last 10 years studies have been done by all the great universities It shows that if increased by 56 percent the possibility of a childno matter what background they come from no matter whatif they start school at three years old they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their livesAnd lets unlock more thanan incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nations Historically Black Colleges and Universities Applause I have a 5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and highdemand fields to compete for the goodpaying jobs in industries likeof the future like cybersecurityThe reason why they donttheirtheir students are equally able to learn as well and get the goodpaying job that start at 90 and 100000 bucks But they dont havethey dont have the backthey dont have the money to provide and build those laboratories So guess what Theyre going to get the money to build those laboratories Applause So instead of just talking about infrastructure lets get about theabout the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways filling the sidewalks and cracks installing streetlights and highspeed Internet creating spacespace to live and work and play safelyLets ensure access to healthcare clean water clean air nearby grocery storesstock the fresh vegetables and food thatapplausein fact deal withI mean these are all things we can doDoes anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments The rich will be just as well off The middle class will do better and everybody will do better Its about goodpaying jobs financial stability and being able to build some generational wealth Its about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world which is now outcompeting usBut just as fundamental as any of these investments Ive discussedthis may be the most fundamental the right to vote Applause The right to vote ApplauseA lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did but I knew him On his deathbed like many I called John to speak to him But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing He died I think about 25 hours later But you know what John said He called the right to vote precious almost sacred He said The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic societyThis sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like Ive never seeneven though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyerwith an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long long time Its simply unAmerican It is not however sadly unprecedented The creed We Shall Overcome is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybodyThe obstacle to procto progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge We saw it in the 60s but with the current assault its not just an echo of a distant history In 2020 we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote restrictive laws lawsuits threats of intimidation voter purges and more We resolved to overcome it all and we did More Americans voted in the last election than anyin the midst of a pandemicthan any election in American history Applause You got voters registered You got voters to the polls The rule of law held Democracy prevailed We overcame But today let me be unequivocal Ive been engaged in this work my whole career and were going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again I will have more to say about this at a later datethe truly unprecedented assault on our democracy an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results But today as for the act of voting itself I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters Applause And in JuneJune should be a month of action on Capitol Hill I hear all the folks on TV saying Why doesnt Biden get this done Well because Biden only has a majority of effectively four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends But were not giving up Earlier this year the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy The Senate will take it up later this month and Im going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passageThe House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act which iswhich is criticalapplauseto providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote To signify the importance of our efforts today Im asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them among her many other responsibilities With her leadership and your support were going to overcome again I promise you But its going to take a hell of a lot of work ApplauseAnd finally we have toand finally we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television NeoNazis white supremacists the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torchesthe veins bulging on theiras they were screaming Remember Just close your eyes and picture what it wasWell Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th 6th it broke her hearta mob of violent white extremiststhugs Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years agoLook around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans Hate that never goes away Hate only hidesJesse I think I mentioned this to you I thought after you guys pushed through with Dr King the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights ActI thought we moved But what I didnt realizeI thought we had made enormous progress and I was so proud to be a little part of it But you know what Rev I didnt realize hate is never defeated it only hides It hides And given a little bit of oxygenjust a little bit oxygenby its leaders it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again as if it never went away And so folks we cantwe must not give hate a safe harbor As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress According to the intelligence community terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today Not ISIS not al Qaedawhite supremacists Applause Thats not me thats the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration Two weeks ago I signed into law the COVID19 Hate Crimes Act which the House had passed and the Senate My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty sicof bigotry But Im going to close where I started To Mother Randle Mother Fletcher Mr Van Ellis to the descendants and to all survivors Thank you Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today Thank you for your courage Thank you for your commitment And thank your children and your grandchildren and your uncand your nieces and your nephews To see and learn from you is a gifta genuine gift Dr John Hope Franklin one of Americas greatest historiansTulsas proud son whose father was a Greenwood survivorsaid and I quote Whatever you do it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hopeOn this sacred and solemn day may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spiritthe spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future that helps us see face to face a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nationIve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today I mean that And the reason is because of this new generation of young people Theyre the best educated theyre the least prejudiced the most open generation in American history And although I have no scientific basis of what Im about to say but those of you who are over 50how often did you ever seehow often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples Not a joke I challenge youfind today when you turn on the stationssit on one station for two hours And I dont know how many commercials youll seeeight to fivetwo to three out of five have mixedrace couples in them Thats not by accident Theyre selling soap man Laughter Not a joke Remember ol Pat Caddell He used to say You want to know whats happening in American culture Watch advertising because they want to sell what they have We have hope in folks like you honey I really mean it We have hope But weve got to give them support We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didnt care deeply about this You sure in the devil didnt come to hear me speak Laughter But I really mean it I really mean it Lets not give up man Lets not give up As the old saying goes Hope springs eternal I know weve talked a lot about famous people but Immy colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets They think I did it because Im Irish They think I did it because we Irishwe have a little chip on our shoulder A little bit sometimes Thats not why I did it I did it because theyre the best poets in the world Laughter You can smile its okay Its true There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called The Cure at TroySeamus Heaney And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people It said History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime the longedfor tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme Lets make it rhyme Thank you

oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nationwe all didthat was in crisisThe worst pandemic in a century The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil WarNow after just 100 days I can report to the nation America is on the move againapplauseturning peril into possibility crisis to opportunity setbacks into strengthWe all know life can knock us down But in America we never ever ever stay down Americans always get up Today thats what were doing America is rising anew choosing hope over fear truth over lies and light over darknessAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal America is ready for takeoff in my view Were working again dreaming again discovering again and leading the world againWe have shown each other and the world that theres no quit in AmericanoneOne hundred days ago Americas house was on fire We had to act And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi MalorMajority Leader Schumer and the overwhelming support of the American peopleDemocrats independents and Republicanswe did actTogether we passed the American Rescue Planone of the most consequential rescue packages in American history Were already seeing the results Applause Were already seeing the results After I promised wed get 100 million COVID19 vaccine shots into peoples arms in 100 days we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days ApplauseThanks to all the help of all of you were marshallingwith your help everyones helpwere marshalling every federal resource Weve gotten vaccines to nearly 40000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached Were setting up community vaccination sites developing mobile units to get to hardtoreach communitiesToday 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site Everyone over the age of 16everyone is now eligible to get vaccinated right now right away Applause Go get vaccinated America Go and get the vaccination Theyre available Youre eligible nowWhen I was sworn in on January 20th less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID19 One hundred days later 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protectedfully protectedSenior deaths from COVID19 are down 80 percent since Januarydown 80 percent because of all of you And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shotAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale Arizona I asked a nurseI said Whats it like She looked at me and she said Its like every shot is giving a dose of hopewas the phrase A dose of hopeA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune diseasewrote to me said shes worriedthat she was worrying about bringing the virus home She said she then got vaccinated at aat a large site in her car She said she sat in her car when she got vaccinated and just criedcried out of joy and cried out of reliefParents see the smiles on their kids faces for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinatedGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbyeIt means everything Those things mean everythingYou know theres stillyou all know it you know it better than any group of Americanstheres still more work to do to beat this virus We cant let our guard downBut tonight I can say it Because of you the American people our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievementslogistical achievements this country has ever seenWhat else have we done in those first 100 daysWe kept our commitmentDemocrats and Republicansof sending 1400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households Weve already sent more than one160 million checks out the door Its making the difference You all know it when you go home For many people its making all the difference in the worldA single mom in Texas who wrote to me she said she couldnt work but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartmentA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctorsomething she said she put off for months because she didnt have the money One of the defining images at least from my perspective of this crisis has been cars lined upcars lined up for miles And notnot people who just barely ever start those carsnice cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunkI dont know about you but I didnt ever think Id see that in America And all of this is through no fault of their own No fault of their own these people are in this positionThats why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger and hunger is down sharply already Were also providing rental assistanceyou all know this but the American people I want to make sure they understandkeeping people from being evicted from their homes providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the jobDuring these 100 days an additional 800000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that800000 in that periodWere making one of the largest onetime ever investmentseverin improving healthcare for veterans Critical investments to address the opioid crisis And maybe most importantly thanks to the American Rescue Plan were on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year ApplauseAnd in the process while this was all going on the economy created more than 1300000 new jobs in 100 daysmore jobs in the firstapplausemore jobs in the first 100 days than any President on recordThe International Monetary Fundapplausethe International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decadesAmerica is movingmoving forwardbut we cant stop now Were in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century Were at a great inflection point in historyWe have to do more than just build back betterI mean build back We have to build back better We have to compete more strenuously than we haveThroughout our history if you think about it public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed Americaour attitudes as well as our opportunitiesThe transcontinental railroad the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of AmericaUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunityScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moonnow were on Mars discovering vaccines gave us the Internet and so much moreThese are the investments we made together as one country and investments that only the government was in a position to make Time and again they propel us into the futureThats why I proposed the American Jobs Plana onceinageneration investment in America itself This is the largest jobs plan since World War TwoIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure jobs modernizing our roads bridges highways jobs building ports and airports rail corridors transit lines Its clean water And today up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them including in drinking watera clear and present danger to our childrens healthThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nations lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water ApplauseAnd in the process it will create thousands and thousands of goodpaying jobs It creates jobs connecting every American with highspeed Internet including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesnt have itThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21stcentury economyAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort if she would THE VICE PRESIDENT Of courseTHE PRESIDENTbecause I know it will get done ApplauseIt creates jobs building a modern power grid Our grids are vulnerable to storms hacks catastrophic failureswith tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter stormsThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid We can do that ApplauseLook the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careersTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemictwo million And too often because they couldnt get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs helpEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability If you think its not important check out in your own districtDemocrat or RepublicanDemocrat or Republican voters their great concernalmost as much as their childrenis taking care of an elderly loved one who cant be left alone Medicaid contemplated it but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits continuing a cycle of growthFor too long weve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis jobs Jobs Jobs Applause For me when I think climate change I think jobsThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energyefficient buildings and homes Electrical workersIBEW membersinstalling 500000 charging stations along our highways so we can ownapplauseso we can own the electric car market ApplauseFarmersfarmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it ApplauseLook but think about it There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines cant be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing No reason None No reason ApplauseSo folks theres no reason why AmericanAmerican workers cant lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries I mean there is no reason We have this capacity Applause We have the brightest besttrained people in the worldThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of goodpaying jobsjobs Americans can raise a family onas my dad would then say with a little breathing roomAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle Buy American Applause Buy AmericanAnd I might note parentheticallyapplausethat does notthat does not violate any trade agreement Its been the law since the 30s Buy American American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs Thats the way its supposed to be and it will be in this administration ApplauseAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously sic limited It will be American productsNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you So many of youso many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind forgotten in an economy thats so rapidly changing Its frightening I want to speak directly to you Because if you think about it thats what people are most worried about Can I fit inIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come It is ait is an eightyear program These are goodpaying jobs that cant be outsourcedNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree 75 percent dont require an associates degreeThe American Jobs Plan is a bluecollar blueprint to build America Thats what it is ApplauseAnd it recognizes something Ive always said in this chamber and the other Good guys and women on Wall Street but Wall Street didnt build this country The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class ApplauseSo thats why Im calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Actthe PRO Actand send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize ApplauseAnd by the way while youre thinking about sending things to my desklaughslets raise the minimum wage to 15 ApplauseNo oneno one working 40 hours a weekno one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty lineWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women And while were doing this lets get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as wellequal pay Its been much too long And if youre wondering whether its too long look behind me ApplauseAnd finally the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record We will see more technological changeand some of you know more about this than I dowell see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 Thats how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changingAnd were falling behind the competition with the rest of the worldDecades ago we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America2 percent of our gross domestic productin research and development Today Mr Secretary thats less than 1 percent China and other countries are closing in fast We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the futureadvanced batteries biotechnology computer chips clean energyThe Secretary of Defense can tell youand those of you onwho work on national security issues knowthe Defense Department has an agency called DARPAthe Defense Advanced Research Project Agency The people who set up before I came hereand thats been a long time agoto develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security thats their only job And its a semiseparate agency its under the Defense Department Its led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our securityThe National Institute of Healththe NIH I believe should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health ApplauseAnd that wouldheres what it would do It would have a singular purpose to develop breakthroughs to prevent detect and treat diseases like Alzheimers diabetes and cancerIll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice Presidentalmost 9 million going to NIH And if you excuse the point of personal privilege Ill never forget you standing and mentioningsaying youd name it after my deceased son It meant a lotBut so many of us have deceased sons daughters and relatives who died of cancer I can think of no more worthy investment I know of nothing that is more bipartisan So lets end cancer as we know it Applause Its within our power Applause Its within our power to do it ApplauseInvestments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones were talking about have often had bipartisan support in the past Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposalSo lets get to work I wanted to lay out before the Congress my plan before we got into the deep discussions Id like to meet with those who have ideas that are differentthey think are better I welcome those ideas But the rest of the world is not waiting for us I just want to be clear From my perspective doing nothing is not an option ApplauseLook we cant be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st centurySecretary Blinken can tell you I spent a lot of time with President Xitraveled over 17000 miles with him spent they tell me over 24 hours in private discussions with him When he called to congratulate me we had a twohour discussion Hes deadly earnest about becoming the most significant consequential nation in the world He and othersautocratsthink that democracy cant compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus To win that competition for the future in my view we also need to make a onceinageneration investment in our families and our children Thats why Ive introduced the American Families Plan tonight which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and in turn AmericaFirst is access to a good education When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century it made us the besteducated bestprepared nation in the world Its I believe the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21stin the 20th century But the world has caught up or catching up They are not waiting I would say parenthetically If we were sitting down put a bipartisan committee together and said Okay were going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education I wonder whether wed think as we did in the 20th century that 12 years is enough in the 21st century I doubt it Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st CenturyThats why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America starting as early as we canThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years It shows that adding two years of universal highquality preschool for every threeyearold and fouryearold no matter what background they come from it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduationThe research shows when a young child goes to schoolnot daycarethey are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high schoolWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that you begin to change the dynamic Applause We can do that Applause And well increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities Tribal Colleges MinorityServing Institutions The reason is They dont have the endowments but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity just as capable of learning about metallurgyall the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the futureJill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady She has long saidapplause She has longapplause If Ive heard it once Ive heard it a thousand times Joe any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us Shell be deeply involved in leading this effort Thank you JillSecond thing we need American Families Plan will provide access to quality affordable childcare We guaranteeapplause And Im proposing a legislation to guarantee that low and middleincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for highquality care for children up to the age of 5 The most hardpressed working families wont have to spend a dimeThird the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leavefamily and medical leave Were one of the few industrial countries in the worldapplause No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones a parent a spouse or childAnd fourth the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family Up to a 3000 per child if theyre under over six years of ageI mean excuse meunderover six years of age and 3600 for children over under six years of ageWith two parents two kids thats 7200 in the pockets thats going to help to take care of your family And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare child poverty in half Applause And we can afford it So we did that in the recin thein the last piece of legislation we passed But lets extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025 ApplauseThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act I know thats really popular on this side of the aisle Laughter But lets make that provision permanent so their premiums dont go back up ApplauseIn addition to my Families Plan Im going to work with Congress to address this year other critical priorities for American families The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans protecting people with preexisting conditions protecting womens health And the pandemic has demonstrated how badlyhow badly its needed Lets lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Carein the Affordable Care Act Applause And lets lower prescription drug costs Applause We know how to do this The last President had that as an objective We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America In fact we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in Americanearly three timesfor the same drug nearly three times what other countries pay We have to change that and we can Lets do what weve always talked about for all the years I was down here in thisin this bodyin Congress Lets give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices ApplauseAnd by the way that wont justthat wont just help people on Medicare it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone And the money we save which is billions of dollars can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny Its within our power to do it lets do it now ApplauseWeve talked about it long enough Democrats and Republicans lets get it done this year This is all about a simple premise Healthcare should be a right not a privilege in America Applause So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan I made it clear we can do it without increasing the deficits Lets start with what I will not do I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than 400000 Itsbut its time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share Applause Just their fair share Sometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire but pay your fair shareA recent study shows that 55 of the nations biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year Those 55 corporations made in excess of 40 billion in profit A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas Its not right Were going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well ApplauseWere going to reward work not just wealth We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americansthose making over 400000 or moreback up to where it was when George W Bush was President when he started 396 percent Thats where it was when George W was President Were going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck Were only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action Three tenths of 1 percent And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes Its estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left right and center Im not looking to punish anybody But I will not add a tax burdenan additional tax burden to the middle class in this country Theyre already paying enough I believe what I propose is fairapplausefiscally responsible and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the countryWhen you hear someone say that they dont want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America ask them Whose taxes you want to raise instead Whose are you going to cut Look the big tax cut of 2017remember it was supposed to pay for itselfthat was how it was soldand generate vast economic growth Instead it added 2 trillion to the deficit It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very topInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs In fact the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history According to one study CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes It used to be in thebelow a hundred The pandemic has only made things worse Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemicworking and middleclass Americans At the same time roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than 1 trillionin the same exact period Let me say it again 650 people increased their wealth by more than 1 trillion during this pandemic And theyre now worth more than 4 trillion My fellow Americans trickledowntrickledown economics has never worked and its time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out Applause You know theres a broad consensus of economistsleft right centerand they agree what Im proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth These are among the highestvalue investments we can make as a nation Ive often said Our greatest strength is the power of our example not just the example of our powerIn my conversations with world leadersand Ive spoken to over 38 40 of them nowIve made it knownIve made it known that America is back And you know what they say The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say We see America is back but for how long But for how longMy fellow Americans we have to show not just that were back but that were back to stay and that we arent going to go it alone Applause Were going to do it by leading with our allies Applause No one nation can deal with all the crises of our timefrom terrorism to nuclear proliferation mass migration cybersecurity climate change as well as experiwhat were experiencing now with pandemics Theres no wall high enough to keep any virus out And our own vaccine supplyas it grows to meet our needs and were meeting themwill become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the worldapplauseand in consequence influenced the world ApplauseBut every American will have access before that occurevery American will have access to be fully covered by COVID19from the vaccines we haveLook the climate crisis is not our fight alone its a global fight The United States accounts as all of you know less than 15 percent of carbon emissions The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent Thats why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accordbecause if we do everything perfectly its not going to ultimately matterI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the worldChina Russia India the European Unionand I said Id do it in my first 100 daysI want to be very blunt about it I hadmy attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus that we are at an inflection point in history And consensusthe consensus is If we act to save the planet we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the worldIf youve watched any of itand you were all busy Im sure you didnt have much timethats what virtually every nation said even the ones that arent doing their fair shareThe investments Ive proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy in my view that benefits the middle class That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy including ChinaIn my discussionsin my discussions with President Xi I told him We welcome the competition Were not looking for conflict But I made absolutely clear that we will defend Americas interests across the board America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries like subsidies from stateto stateowned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual propertyI also told President Xi that well maintain a strong military presence in the IndoPacific just as we do with NATO in Europenot to start a conflict but to prevent one Applause I told him what Ive said to many world leaders that America will not back away from our commitmentsour commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliancesAnd I pointed out to him No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated An American PresidentPresident has to represent the essence of what our country stands for America is an ideathe most unique idea in history We are created all of us equal Its who we are and we cannot walk away from that principle and in fact say were dealing with the American ideaWith regard to Russia I know it concerns some of you but I made very clear to Putin that were not going to seek escaecalaexcexcuse meescalation but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true And they turned out to be true so I responded directly and proportionally to Russias interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business They did both of these things and I told them we would respond and we haveBut we can also cooperate when its in our mutual interest We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms and were working to do it on climate change But he understands we will respondOn Iran and North Koreanuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the worldwere going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through dithrough diplomacy as well as stern deterrenceAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan Applause We haveapplausewe have without hyperbole the greatest fighting force in the history of the world Im the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 911The War in Afghanistan as we remember the debates here were never meant to be multigenerational undertakings of nationbuilding We went to Afghanistan to get terroriststhe terrorists who attacked us on 911and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it If youve been to the upper Kunar Valley youve kind of seen the gates of hell And we delivered justice to bin Laden We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan And after 20 years of valuevalor and sacrifice its time to bring those troops home Applause Look even as we do we will maintain an overthehorizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland And make no mistake In 20 years terrorists hasterrorism has metastasized The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan And those of you in the intelligence committees the foreign relations committee the defense committees you know well We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen Syria Somalia other places in Africa the Middle East and beyond And we wont ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today White supremacy is terrorism Were not going to ignore that eitherMy fellow Americans look we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation It was nearly a year ago before her fathers funeral when I spoke with Gianna Floyd George Floyds young daughter Shes a little tyke so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye And she looked at me and she said My daddy changed the world Well after the conviction of George Floyds murderer we can see how right she was ifif we have the courage to act as a Congress Weve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans Now is our opportunity to make some real progress The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities and they serve them honorably I know them I know they wantapplauseI know they want to help meet this moment as wellMy fellow Americans we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system and to enact police reform in George Floyds name that passed the House already I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate We need to work together to find a consensus But lets get it done next month by the first anniversary of George Floyds death Applause The country supports this reform and Congress should actshould act We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justicereal justice And with the plans outlined tonight we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways a chance to deliver real equitygood jobs good schools affordable housing clean air clean water being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house Real opportunities in the lives of more AmericansBlack white Latino Asian Americans Native AmericansLook I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Applause You acted decisively Applause And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes weve seen over the past yearthis past year and for too long I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk which I will gladly anxiously signI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans Applause To all transgender Americans watching at home especially young people who are so brave I want you to know your President has your backAnother thing Lets authorize the Violence Against Women Act which has been law for 27 years Applause Twentyseven years ago I wrote it Itll close thethe act that has to be authorized now will close the boyfriend loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers The court order said This is an abuser You cant own a gun Its to close that loophole that existed You know its estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America50 a month Lets pass it and save some lives ApplauseAnd I need notI need not tell anyone this but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in AmericaThe flag at the White House was still flying at halfmast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in ColoradoAnd in the week in between those two events 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America250 shot deadI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue In the 90s we passed universal background checks a ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds We beat the NRA Mass shootings and gun violence declined Check out the report in over 10 years But in the early twe2000s the law expired and weve seen daily bloodshed since Im not saying if the law continued we wouldnt see bloodshedMore than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden surrounded by some of the bravest people I knowthe survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violenceI laid out several of the Department of Justice aactions that are being taken toimpact on this epidemic One of them is banning socalled ghost guns These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm The parts have no serial numbers so they show up at crime scenes and they cant be traced The buyers of these ghost gun kits arent required to pass any background check Anyone from a criminal or terrorist could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon thats lethal But no moreAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence but its time for Congress to act as well ApplauseLook I dont want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns We need a ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines And dont tell me it cant be done We did it before and it workedTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters Theyll tell you theres no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon What do you thinkdeer are wearing Kevlar vests Laughter Theyll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldnt be able to buy a gunThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people including many gun owners The country supports reform and isand Congress should actThis shouldnt be a red or blue issue And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute You cant yell Fire in a crowded theater From the very beginning there were certain guns weapons that could not be owned by Americans Certain people could not own those weapons ever Were not changing the Constitution were being reasonable I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue I think its an American issueAnd heres what else we can do Immigration has always been essential to America Lets end our exhausting war over immigration For more than 30 years politicians have talked about immigration reform and weve done nothing about it Its time to fix itOn day one of my presidency I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress If you believe we need to secure the border pass it because it has a lot of money for hightech border security If you believe in a pathway to citizenship pass it so over 11 million undocumented folksthe vast majority are here overstaying visas Pass it We can actuallyif you actually want to solve a problem Ive sent a bill to take a close look at it We have toalso have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing particularly toto our southern border from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador the violence the corruption the gangs and the political instability hunger hurricanes earthquakes natural disastersWhen I was President my Presidentwhen I was Vice President the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave The plan was working but the last administration decided it was not worth itIm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this I have absolute confidence shell get the job done ApplauseNow look if you dont like my plan lets at least pass what we all agree on Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMersthe young people who have only known America as their home Applause And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and naturalmade violence and disaster ApplauseAs well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables Applause Look immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history The country supports immigration reform We should act Lets argue over it lets debate it but lets act ApplauseAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America we need to protect the sacred right to vote Most peopleapplauseMore people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history in the middle of the worst pandemic ever It should be celebrated Instead its being attackedCongress should pass HR 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away Applause The country supports it The Congress should act now ApplauseLook in closing as we gather here tonight the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol desecrating our democracy remain vivid in all our mindsLives were put at riskmany of your lives Lives were lost Extraordinary courage was summoned The insurrection was an existential crisis a test of whether our democracy could survive And it didBut the struggle is far from over The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent as old as our Republicstill vital today Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us created equal in the image of God have a chance to lead lives of dignity respect and possibilityCan our democracy deliver the mostto the most pressing needs of our people Can our democracy overcome the lies anger hate and fears that have pulled us apartAmericas adversaries the autocrats of the world are betting we cant And I promise you theyre betting we cant They believe were too full of anger and division and rageThey look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy But they are wrong You know it I know it But we have to prove them wrongWe have to prove democracy still worksthat our government still works and we can deliver for our peopleIn our first 100 days together we have acted to restore the peoples faith in democracy to deliver Were vaccinating the nation Were creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs Were delivering real results to people they can see it and feel it in their own livesOpening doors of opportunity guaranteeing some more fairness and justicethats the essence of America Thats democracy in actionOur Constitution opens with the wordsas trite as it soundsWe the People Well its time to remember that We the People are the governmentyou and I Not some force in a distant capital Not some powerful force that we have no control over Its us Its We the PeopleIn another era when our democracy was tested Franklin Roosevelt reminded us In America we do our part We all do our part Thats all Im asking that we do our part all of usIf we do that we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong Autocrats will not win the future We will America will And the future belongs to AmericaAs I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation and I can say with absolute confidence I have never been more confident or optimistic about Americanot because Im President because whats happening with the American peopleWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy pandemic and pain and We the People did not flinchAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail we came together We unitedWith light and hope we summoned a new strength new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century on our way to a union more perfect more prosperous and more just as one people one nation and one AmericaFolks as I told every world leader Ive ever met with over the years its never ever ever been a good bet to bet against America and it still isnt ApplauseWe are the United States of America Applause There is not a single thingnothingnothing beyond our capacity We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together Applause So lets begin to get together ApplauseGod bless you all and may God protect our troops Thank you for your patience Applause
"March 31, 2021: Announcing the American Jobs Plan",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-31-2021-announcing-american-jobs-plan,Joe Biden,2021-03-31,"At the Carpenters Training Center in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, President Biden announces the details of the American Jobs Plan. The plan proposes to modernize existing transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and airports, and build new rail corridors and transit lines. It will also work to tackle climate change by cutting pollution and providing incentives for Americans to buy clean cars. The plan will also focus on replacing the nation's lead pipes and providing high-speed internet service. President Biden plans to pay for the plan by increasing the corporate tax rate, and he makes a plea for bipartisan support for the plan.",THE PRESIDENT Thank you Applause Inaudible Mike asked me and I said to Bobby my good friend he asked me back there he said Do you ever get nervous And I he said Because I got up this morning made breakfast for my kids Ive got to introduce the President And what I say to you Mike You did a heck of a job But Id get nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night climb up a telephone pole replace in the middle of a storm a connection that knocked out everybodys electricity and put a transformer in Thats what would make me nervous So what you did was really good I couldnt do what you do pal I couldnt do what you do And I want to and its true Mike Youre a union guy me too I got in trouble but I dont make any apologies for it Im a union guy I support unions Unions built the middle class Its about time they start to get a piece of the action To all my colleagues applause to the County Executives to the Mayor to everyone whos here I want to say Thank you Thank you Congressman for the passport into your district And I appreciate being here Im honored to be with you Two years ago I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America And today I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that rebuild the backbone of America Its a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington but through the eyes of hardworking people like the people I grew up with people like Mike and his union family union workers in this Carpenters Training Center people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont Delaware People who get up every day work hard raise their family pay their taxes serve their country and volunteer for their communities and just looking for a little bit of breathing room just a little bit of light Ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things The people who break their necks every day for their families and the country they love a country that in fact which on the day I was elected was in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed four thou excuse me five hundred I carry it in my pocket every day I have the list of exactly how many have died 547296 Americans dead from the virus more than all the people killed in World War One World War Two the Vietnam War 911 547296 Americans And an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety Thats why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress I really mean that It didnt pass by a whole lot but with the leadership of Conor and Bobby and Mayor just you got it done because it was an emergency We needed to act to save jobs to save businesses and to save lives And thats what we did Were beginning to see the results Were on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my presidency When I said Id get 100 million done people thought it was a significant exaggeration Were going to get 200 million done twice the original goal because of all the help of all of you Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year Thats a rate we havent seen in years and years We can cut child poverty in half this year With the American Rescue Plan were meeting immediate emergencies Now its time to rebuild Even before the crisis were now facing those at the very top in America were doing very well which is fine They were doing great But everyone else was falling behind The pandemic only made the division so much worse and more obvious Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their net worth increase by 4 trillion It just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become It wasnt always this way Well its time to change that Id note parenthetically that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middleclass and poor folks this last time I didnt hear that cry hue and cry when we were doing the same thing when Trumps tax bill passed and 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent You know this is not to target those whove made it not to seek retribution This is about opening opportunities for everybody else And heres the truth We all will do better when we all do well Its time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out not the top down It hadnt worked very well For the economy overall it hadnt worked because Wall Street didnt build this country you the great middle class built this country And unions built the middle class Applause And its time in this time well rebuild the middle class Were going to bring everybody along Regardless of your background your color your religion inaudible everybody gets to come along So today Im proposing a plan for the nation that rewards work not just rewards wealth It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed and its going to create the strongest most resilient innovative economy in the world Its not a plan that tinkers around the edges Its a onceina generation investment in America unlike anything weve seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and the Space Race decades ago In fact its the largest American jobs investment since World War Two It will create millions of jobs goodpaying jobs It will grow the economy make us more competitive around the world promote our national security interests and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years Is it big Yes Is it bold Yes And we can get it done It has two parts the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan Both are essential to our economic future In a few weeks Ill talk about the Americans Family Plan but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan Ill begin with the heart of the plan It modernizes transportation infrastructure our roads our bridges our airports I just left your airport The director of the airport said Were about to renovate the airport Is that right Mr County Executive Were going to renovate Were going to employ thousands of people And she looked at me and said I cant thank you enough for this plan It grows the economy in key ways It puts people to work to repair and upgrade so that we badly need It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods to get to work and to make us more competitive around the world Some of your local officials know when someone wants to come into the area and a company wants to invest what do they ask Wheres the first rail bed How can I get to the railroad What access to interstate do I have Whats the water like Tell me about it And it goes on and on Its about infrastructure The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20000 miles of highways roads and main streets that are in difficult difficult shape right now Itll fix the nations 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement Remember that bridge that went down We got 10 of the most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it that need to be replaced Well also repair 10000 bridges desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic keep people safe and connect our cities towns and Tribes across the country The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines easing congestion cutting pollution slashing commute times and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities and cities to the outskirts where a lot of jobs are these days Itll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity Itll protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super storms floods wildfires droughts year after year by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seizing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future Skilled workers like one we just heard from building a nationwide network of 500000 charging stations creating goodpaying jobs by leading the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks Were going to provide tax incentives and pointofsale reberts sic rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future The federal government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States by American workers with American products When we make all these investments were going to make sure as the executive order I signed early on that we buy American That means investing in Americanbased companies and American workers Not a contract will go out that I control that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products all the way down the line and American workers And well buy the goods we need from all of America communities that have historically been left out of these investments Black Latino Asian American Native American rural small businesses entrepreneurs across the country Look today up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400000 schools and childcare centers have pipes where they get their water from pipes that are leadbased pipes including pipes for drinking water According to scientists there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child Lead can slow development cause learning behaviors and hearing problems The American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing 100 percent of the nations lead pipes and service lines so every American every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water With each 5000 investment replacing a line that can mean up to 22000 in healthcare costs saved a chance to protect our children help them learn and thrive We cant delay We cant delay another minute Its long past due You know in America where the early interest was in Internet this thing called the Internet that we invested we invented the early the early Internet was invented here Millions of Americans though lack access to reliable highspeed Internet including more than 35 percent of rural America Its a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic American Jobs will make sure every single every single American has access to high quality affordable highspeed Internet for businesses for schools And when I say affordable I mean it Americans pay too much for Internet service Were going to drive down the price for families who have service now and make it easier for families who dont have affordable service to be able to get it now As you saw in Texas and elsewhere our electric and power power grids are vulnerable to storms catastrophic failures and security lapses with tragic results My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work hundred of thousands of people to work line workers electricians and laborers laying thousands of miles of transmission line building a modern resilient and fully clean grid and capping hundreds of thousands of literally orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because theyre abandoned paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place Well build upgrade and weatherize affordable energyefficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans Even before the pandemic millions of working families faced enormous enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time the socalled sandwich generation or family members with disability You got a child at home you cant stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose youre going to put the child at risk or you lose your job or you have an elderly parent youre taking care of And seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well But we know if they can remain independently living they live longer The American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways Its going to extend access to quality affordable home or communitybased care Think of expanded vital services like programs for seniors or think of homecare workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities cooking meals helping them get around their homes and helping them be able to live more independently For too long caregivers who are disproportionately women and women of color and immigrants have been unseen underpaid and undervalued This plan along with the American Families Plan changes that with better wages benefits and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them You know decades ago the United States government used to spend 2 percent of its GDP its gross domestic product on research and development Today we spend less than 1 percent I think its seventenths of 1 percent Heres why that matters Were one of only a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly over the last 25 years And weve fallen back The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast We cant allow this to continue The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal nondefense research and development spending on record Its going to boost Americas innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs markets like battery technology biotechnology computer chips clean energy the competition with China in particular Critics say we shouldnt spend this money They ask What do we get out of it Well they said the same thing when we first flew into space for the first time They said the same thing Well pushing the frontiers led to big benefits back home When NASA created Apollos digital flight control system unheard of at the time it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes When NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts it led to programs that have been used to for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets At least 2000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration GPS has helped us find each other Computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another even when were separated by mountains and oceans singing Happy Birthday and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild comforting each other when comfort is needed Think about what it means to you and your loved ones We just have to imagine again I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping the leader of China when he called to congratulate me We spent two hours on the phone And he said and was astonished by NASAs security team and the China experts who were on the line he said Youve always said Mr President that you can define America in one word possibilities Thats who we are In America anything is possible Like what we did with vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID19 vaccines we have today Like we did when the Interstate Highway System that transformed the way we traveled lived worked and developedAmericans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon Businesses here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix To this day about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year on one of those very original highways Imagine what we can do whats within our reach when we modernize those highways You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a highspeed train We can connect highspeed affordable reliable Internet wherever you live Imagine knowing that youre handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology and will need to address one of the biggest threats of our time Thats what well do Altogether along with the American Rescue Plan the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs estimated by some Wall Street outfits over 18 million jobs over four years goodpaying jobs It also works to level the playing field empower workers and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs that you can raise a family on and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively Thats why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act the PRO Act and send it to my desk This plan is important not only for what and how it builds but its also important to where we build It includes everyone regardless of your race or your ZIP Code Too often economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast Too often investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind There is talent innovation everywhere And this plan connects that talent through cities small towns rural communities through our businesses and our universities through our entrepreneurs union workers all across America We have to move now Because Im convinced that if we act now in 50 years people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future What Im proposing is a onetime capital investment of roughly 2 trillion in Americas future spread largely over eight yearsIt will generate historic job growth historic economic growth help businesses to compete internationally create more revenue as well They are among the highestvalue investments we can make in the nation investing in our infrastructureBut put it another way failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors Thats what crumbling infrastructure does And our infrastructure is crumbling Were ranked 13th in the world Whats more it heightens our vulnerability to it attac attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they havent up to now And our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure Put simply these are investments we have to make We can afford to make them or put another way we cant afford not to So how do we pay for it I spoke to the Majority Leader and no longer I guess hes no longer the Majority Leader he has been for a long time I spoke for the Republican I spoke to the Republican Leader about the plan Everybody is for doing something on infrastructure Why havent we done it Well no one wants to pay for it Less than four years ago as I said the Congress passed a tax cut of 2 trillion increasing the national debt 2 trillion It didnt meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy Overwhelmingly the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans It even included new investments that would profit by shifting profits and jobs overseas if youre a corporation It was bad for American competitiveness deeply unfair to the middleclass families and wrong for our futureSo heres what Id do I start with one rule No one let me say it again no one making under 400000 will see their federal taxes go up Period This is not about penalizing anyone I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires I believe American in American capitalism I want everyone to do well But heres the deal Right now a middleclass couple a firefighter and a teacher with two kids making a combined salary of say 110 120000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad brings it home and then sell it they pay nothing at all Were going to raise the corporate tax It was 35 percent which is too high We all agreed five years ago it should go down to 28 percent but they reduced it to 21 percent Were going to raise it back to up to 28 percent No one should be able to complain about that Its still lower than what that rate was between World War Two and 2017 Just doing that one thing will generate 1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 yearsIn 2019 an independent analysis found that are 91 let me say it again 91 Fortune 500 companies the biggest companies in the world including Amazon they used various loopholes so theyd pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax I dont want to punish them but thats just wrong Thats just wrong A fireman and a teacher paying 22 percent Amazon and 90 other major corporations are paying zero in federal taxesIm going to put an end to that and heres how well do it Were establishing a global minimum tax for US corporations of 21 percent Were going to level the international playing field That alone will raise 1 trillion over 15 years Well also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas You do that you pay a penalty you dont get a reward in my plan And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here in manufacturing and production here in the United States And well significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their incomes or underreport Its estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars All of this adds up to more than what Ive proposed to spend in just 15 yearsIts honest Its fiscally responsible And by the way as the experts will tell you it reduces the debt the federal debt over the long haulBut let me be clear These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan If others have additional ideas let them come forward Im open to other ideas so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than 400000 Let me close with this Historically infrastructure had been a bipartisan undertaking many times led by RepublicansIt was Abraham Lincoln who built the transcontinental railroad Dwight Eisenhower a Republican the Interstate Highway System I could go onAnd I dont think youll find a Republican today in the House or Senate maybe Im wrong gentlemen who doesnt think we have to improve our infrastructure They know China and other countries are eating our lunch So theres no reason why it cant be bipartisan again The divisions of the moment shouldnt stop us from doing the right thing for the future Im going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office listen to them what they have to say and be open to other ideas Well have a goodfaith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done But we have to get it done I truly believe were in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice that had to be made between democracies and autocracies You know theres a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why theyre going to win is democracies cant reach consensus any longer autocracies do Thats what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about Its a basic question Can democracies still deliver for their people Can they get a majority I believe we can I believe we must Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was all about And its been overwhelmingly popular When I wrote it everybody said I had no bipartisan support Were overwhelming bipartisan support with Republican registered Republican voters And ask around If you live in a town with a Republican mayor a Republican county executive or a Republican governor ask them how many would rather get rid of the plan Ask them if it helped them at allIts what the American Jobs Plan is about the new one Im proposing I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort I hope and I believe a number of businesses will join this effort And I hope and believe the American people will join this effort Democrats Republican and independents We can do this We have to do this We will do this We just have to remember This is the United States of America And Ive said it a thousand times Theres nothing beyond our capacity if we act together So its time to move together Thank you and I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed And the question is You have to attract even more apprentices more people because were building so much God bless you all And may God protect our troops Thank you Applause
"March 25, 2021: First Press Conference",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-25-2021-first-press-conference,Joe Biden,2021-03-25,"President Joe Biden holds the first press conference of his presidency. He begins with a progress report on the vaccination efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. He also responds to questions from the press about immigration, the Senate filibuster, Afghanistan, and voting rights.",THE PRESIDENT Please please sit down Thank you Thank you Good afternoon Before I take questions I want to make give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American peopleFirst on vaccinations On December 8th I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in peoples arms in my first 100 days We met that goal last week by day 58 42 days ahead of scheduleNow today Im setting a second goal and that is We will by my 100th day in office have administered 200 million shots in peoples arms Thats right 200 million shots in 100 daysI know its ambitious twice our original goal but no other country in the world has even come close not even close to what we are doing And I believe we can do itAnd today weve made a historic investment in reaching the hardesthit and the most vulnerable communities the highestrisk communities as a consequence of the virus by investing an addition 10 billion in being able to reach themI also set a goal before I took office of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days Now thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration educators parents local state education officials and leaders a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the Kthrough8 schools are open now full time five days a week for inperson learning Not yet a majority but were really close And I believe in the 35 days left to go well meet that goal as wellAs of yesterday more than 100 million payments of 1400 have gone into peoples bank accounts Thats real money in peoples pockets bringing relief instantly almost And millions more will be getting their money very soonOne final note Since we passed the American Rescue Plan were starting to see new signs of hope in our economy Since it was passed a majority a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth thats going to take place this year Theyre now projecting it will exceed 6 percent a 6 percent growth in GDPAnd just this morning we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100000 persons Thats the first time in a year the number has fallen below the prepandemic highSo there are still too many Americans out of work too many families hurting and we still have a lot of work to doBut I can say to you the American people Help is here and hope is on the wayNow Ill be happy to take your questionsZeke the Associated PressQ Thank you Mr President You mentioned your progress on COVID19 Id like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform gun control voting rights climate change All of those right now are facing stiff united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American peopleTHE PRESIDENT Well Im going to look when I took office I decided that it was a fairly basic simple proposition and that is I got elected to solve problems And the most urgent problem facing the American people I stated from the outset was COVID19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans And so thats why I put all my focus in the beginning there are a lot of problems put all my focus on dealing with those particular problemsAnd the other problems were talking about from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned are longterm problems theyve been around a long time And what were going to be able to do God willing is now begin one at a time to focus on those as well and whether its immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the countryBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance whether theyre going to lose a family member whether theyre going to be in a position where theyre not going to be theyre going to lose their home because they cant pay their mortgage or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to to pay their rentSo were going to move on these one at a time try to do as many simultaneously as we can But thats the reason why I focused as I haveAnd heres the deal I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to is to just decide to divide the country continue the politics of division But Im not going to do that Im just going to move forward and take these things as they comeQ And just to to follow up Mr President can your presidency be a success if you cant make progress on those four challenges climate change immigration reform gun control voting rightsTHE PRESIDENT Well I plan on making progress on all of them but thats going to be for the American people to decideI think you know I doubt whether maybe you did maybe others did I thought many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed passed without any Republican votes A pretty big deal It got passed Growing the economy Peoples lives are changingSo lets see what happens All I know Ive been hired to solve problems to solve problems not create divisionOkay How about YamicheQ Thanks so much Mr President Youve said over and over again that immigrants shouldnt come to this country right now this isnt the time to come That message is not being received Instead the perception of you that got you elected as a moral decent man is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minorsHow do you resolve that tension And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go given the fact that even though with Title 42 there are some families that are staying And is there a timeline for when we wont be seeing these overcrowded facilities with run by CPB sic when it comes to unaccompanied minorsTHE PRESIDENT Well look I guess I should be flattered people are coming because Im the nice guy thats the reason why its happening that Im a decent man or however its phrased That you know thats why theyre coming because they know Biden is a good guyThe truth of the matter is Nothing has changed As many people came 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration 31 percent in the last year of in 2019 before the pandemic in the Trump administration It happens every single solitary year There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January February March That happens every yearIn addition to that there is a and nobody and by the way does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border Thats not the reason theyre comingThe reason theyre coming is that its the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert number one Number two theyre coming because of the circumstances incountry incountryThe way to deal with this problem and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator I mean Vice President putting together a bipartisan plan of over 700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leavingWhat did Trump do He eliminated that funding He didnt use it He didnt do it And in addition to that what he did he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and and has been continued to be a problem for a long time He in fact shut down the the number of beds available He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days a little while But he dismantled all of thatAnd so what were doing now is attempting to rebuild rebuild the system that can accommodate the what is happening today And I like to think its because Im a nice guy but its not Its because of whats happened every yearLet me say one other thing on this If you take a look at the number of people who are coming the vast majority the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back are being sent back Thousands tens of thousands of people who are who are over 18 years of age and single people one at a time coming have been sent back sent homeWere sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming Were trying to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those families back But we thats whats happening Theyre not getting across the borderAnd those who are coming across the border who are unaccompanied children were moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled as I said For example of all the children who are coming across the border over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old Were not talking about people ripping babies from mothers arms or little threeyearolds standing on the border Less than I think its one and a half percent fall in the category of the very youngSo what were doing is were providing for the space again to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities which no child no one should be in any longer than 72 hoursAnd today I went to for example I used all the resources available to me went to the Defense Department and and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss 5000 beds be made easily available Five thousand beds on the Texas borderSo were building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled Its going to take timeAnd the other thing were doing I might add am I giving you too long an answer Because if you dont want the details Q InaudibleTHE PRESIDENT No no but I mean I dont know how much detail you want about immigration Maybe Ill stop there and fin Q My followup question is One if you could talk a little bit about which families why theyre being allowed to stay The families that are being allowed to stay why theyre being allowed to stayAnd in addition to that when it comes to the filibuster which is what Zeke was asking about theres immigration is a big issue of course when it related to the filibuster but theres also Republicans who are passing bill after bill trying to restrict voting rights Chuck Schumer is calling it an existential threat to democracy Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigrationJim Clyburn someone who of course who you know very well has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rightsTHE PRESIDENT Well look Im going to deal with all of those problems The question is the priorities as they come and land on my plateLets go to the first question you asked the first of the second question you asked And that is What about dealing with families Why are not some not going back Because Mexico is refusing to take them back Theyre saying they wont take them back not all of themWere in negotiations with the President of Mexico I think were going to see that change They should all be going back all be going back The only people were not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are childrenAnd what were doing there and its an important point to understand I know you understand I dont mean to say it that way an important point to focus on The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States a mother a father a close relative a grandmom or a grandpopWhat was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks and maybe even months before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there Well weve set up a system now where within 24 hours theres a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom a dad andor a close relative Theyre establishing that right off the batIf it in fact is Mom or Dad Dad says to take the extreme case I got a birth certificate Then guess what Were getting that kid directly to that parent immediatelyAnd so thats going to reduce significantly theres two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable like being held at a Border Patrol station One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that were occupying now both licensed beds around the country that exist as well as for example federal resources like Fort Bliss to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determinedQ And can you answer the filibuster inaudibleTHE PRESIDENT Filibuster Filibuster You know with regard to the filibuster I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago And that is that it used to be required for the filibuster and I had a card on this I was going to give you the statistics but you probably know them that it used to be that that from between 1917 to 1971 the filibuster existed there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time Last year alone there were five times that many So its being abused in a gigantic wayAnd for example it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed And guess what People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing Filibusters broke down and we were able to break the filibuster get a quorum and voteSo I strongly support moving in that direction in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy like the right to vote like the basic right to vote Weve amended the filibuster in the pastBut heres the deal As you observed Im a fairly practical guy I want to get things done I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people And in order to do that in a 5050 Senate weve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie or I get 51 votes without herAnd so Im going to say something outrageous I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate So the best way to get something done if you if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to anyway I were going to get a lot done And if we have to if theres complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster then well have to go beyond what Im talking aboutOkay Hang on Sorry Oh Seung Min Ms KimQ Thank you Mr President to follow up on the filibuster So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51THE PRESIDENT Laughs If we could end it with 51 we would have no problem Youre going to have to the existing rule its going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster the existence of a filibusterBut its not my expertise in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate but in the meantime we got a lot we can do while were talking about what were going to do about the filibusterLet me get here Okay Cecilia Vega Q Id like to circle back to immigration please You just listed the reasons that people are coming talking about incountry problems saying that it happens every year you blamed the last administration Sir I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nineyearold Yossell who walked here from Honduras by himself along with another little boy He had that phone number on him THE PRESIDENT AstoundingQ and we were able to call his family His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son Thats why she sent him alone from HondurasSo sir you blamed the last administration but is your messaging in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process encouraging families like Yossell says to comeTHE PRESIDENT Well look the idea that Im going to say which I would never do if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border were just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side no previous administration did that either except Trump Im not going to do it Im not going to do itThats why Ive asked the Vice President of the United States yesterday to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador in the first place Its because of earthquakes floods Its because of lack of food Its because of gang violence Its because of a whole range of thingsThat when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like in one of the major cities the reason people were leaving is they couldnt walk in the street because they were getting their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violenceWell what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state because so many are corrupt but I was able to say Okay you need lighting in the streets to change things Ill put the lighting in We got a contractor We got the type of lighting We paid directly to the contractor it did not go through the government And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city Fewer people sought to leaveWhen this hurricane occurred two hurricanes instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didnt have housing or water or sustenance we did nothing Were going to do a lot in our administration Were going to be spending that 700plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first placeThat mother did not sit around with on the kitchen table and say You know I got a great idea The way Im going to make sure my son get taken care of is Im going to put a how old was he or sheQ Hes hes nine I also met a 10yearoldTHE PRESIDENT A nineyearold Im going to send him on a thousandmile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and hell take care of himWhat a desperate act to have to take The circumstances must be horrible So we can do something about that Thats what the Vice President is going to be doing what I did When President Obama asked me to come and deal I was in I was in Turkey at the time and he said You got to come home and take care of this So we put together a plan and it had an impactAnd so the question here is whether how we go ahead and do this what we do Theres no easy answerQ A quick follow if I may Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country or should they be deported eventuallyTHE PRESIDENT Well the judgment has to be made whether or not and in this young mans case he has a mom at home theres an overwhelming reason why hed be put in a plane and flown back to his momQ Final follow sir You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna Texas I was there is at 1556 percent capacity THE PRESIDENT YepQ right now with mostly unaccompanied minors There are kids that are sleeping on floors They are packed into these pods Ive spoken to lawyers who say that they some of these children have not seen the sun in days Whats your reaction what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility Is whats happening inside acceptable to you And when is this going to be fixedTHE PRESIDENT Is thats a serious question rightIs it acceptable to me Come on Thats why were going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly Thats why I got Fort Bliss opened up Thats why Ive been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely not just children but particularly children to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of whats happeningThat is totally unacceptableKenQ Thank you Mr President I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of US troops from that country As a candidate in foreign affairs you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the US will no longer have forces in AfghanistanTHE PRESIDENT The answer is that its going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline Just in terms of tactical reasons its hard to get those troops out So what weve been doing what Ive been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing has been weve been meeting with our allies those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well And if we leave were going to do so in a safe and orderly wayWere in consultation I said with our allies and partners in how to proceed And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies particularly those who have forces thereAnd General Austin is just met with Ghani and Im waiting for the briefing on that He is the the leader quote in Afghanistan and Kabul And theres a UNled process thats beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people how to end this warBut it is not my intention to stay there for a long time But the question is How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like its not being able to be worked out to begin with How is that done But we are not staying a long timeQ You just said if we leave Do you think its possible that weTHE PRESIDENT We will leave The question is when we leaveQ Do you sorry do you believe though its possible we could have troops there next yearTHE PRESIDENT I I cant picture that being the caseOkay KristenQ Thank you very much Mr President Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the US border will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forwardTHE PRESIDENT I will commit when my plan very shortly is underway to let you have access to not just them but to other facilities as wellQ How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities Weve obviously been allowed to be inside one but we havent seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that Will you commit to transparency on this issue Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I will commit to transparency and as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right nowAnd one of the reasons I havent gone down I have all my my chief folks have gone down is I dont want to become the issue I dont want to be you know bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way So this is being set up and youll have full access to everything once we get this thing movingQ Okay And just to be clear How soon will that be Mr PresidentTHE PRESIDENT I dont know to be clearQ Okay And do you bear responsibility for everything thats happening at the border now I hear you talking a lot about the past administration You decided to roll back some of those policies did you move too quickly to roll back inaudible policiesTHE PRESIDENT To roll back what Im sorryQ Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessorTHE PRESIDENT First of all all the policies that were underway were not helping at all did not slow up the amount of immigration and theres many people comingAnd rolling back the policies of separating children from from their mothers I make no apology for that Rolling back the policies of Remain in Mexico sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and I make no apologies for thatI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law international law as well as on human dignity And so I make no apologies for thatQ If I could just ask you about foreign policy Mr President Overnight we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles What if any actions will you take And what is your red line on North KoreaTHE PRESIDENT Let me say that number one UN Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested number one Were consulting with our allies and partners And there will be responses if they choose to escalate we will respond accordinglyBut Im also prepared for some form of diplomacy but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization So thats what were doing right now consulting with our alliesQ Just a very quick followup THE PRESIDENT Youve only got another hour now okayQ Diplomacy Can you define what you mean And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching Is that how you assess the crisis in North KoreaTHE PRESIDENT YesOkay Hang on a second here Kristen Nancy CBSQ Thank you very much Mr President I want to go back to voting rights And as Yamiche mentioned Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting particularly Democrats fear impacting minority voters and young voters the very people who helped to get you elected in NovemberAre you worried that if you dont manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022THE PRESIDENT What Im worried about is how unAmerican this whole initiative is Its sick Its sick Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote deciding that youre going to end voting at five oclock when working people are just getting off work deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstancesIts all designed and Im going to spend my time doing three things One trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House number one Number two educating the American public The Republican voters I know find this despicable Republican voters the folks out in outside this White House Im not talking about the elected officials Im talking about voters VotersAnd so I am convinced that well be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle I mean this is gigantic what theyre trying to do and it cannot be sustainedIm going to do everything in my power along with my friends in the House and the Senate to keep that from from becoming the lawQ Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislationTHE PRESIDENT The answer is yes but Im not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you nowQ And then on a related note have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024 You havent set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor had by this timeTHE PRESIDENT Laughs My predecessor need do sic needed to My predecessor Oh God I miss himQ Have you have you THE PRESIDENT No the answer is yes My plan is to run for reelection Thats my expectationQ And then on on one other note on bipartisanship Your old friend Mitch McConnell says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office Do you see it the same way he does Have you rejected bipartisanshipTHE PRESIDENT No I havent at all Ive been meeting when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues Everything from how we work were working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game how we can work together And were working together on a bunch of thingsBut look I know Mitch well Mitch knows me well I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said But this is a matter of making sure that I would like Republican elected Republican support but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters Republican voters agree with what Im doingAnd so unless Mitch says the last thing I did is the last piece of legislation is so far left well then he ought to a look at his party Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I didOkay Where am I here Let me see KaitlanQ Thank you very much Mr President I have a question for you but first Id like to follow up on a question from Yamiche and thats on the filibusterTHE PRESIDENT That counts as a question but go aheadQ Okay Ill make it quick Its a quick questionTHE PRESIDENT No no you canQ Regarding the filibuster At John Lewiss funeral President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era Do you agreeTHE PRESIDENT YesQ And if not why not abolish it if its a relic of the Jim Crow eraTHE PRESIDENT Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible Lets figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first Its been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years Lets deal with the abuse firstQ It sounds like youre moving closer to eliminating the filibuster Is that correctTHE PRESIDENT I answered your questionQ You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelectionTHE PRESIDENT I said That is my expectationQ So is that a yes that you are running for reelectionTHE PRESIDENT Look I I dont know where you guys come from man Ive never been able to travel Im a great respecter of fate Ive never been able to plan four and half three and a half years ahead for certainQ And if you do THE PRESIDENT It Q If you do run will Vice President Harris be on your ticketTHE PRESIDENT I would fully expect that to be the case Shes doing a great job Shes a great partner Shes a great partnerQ And do you believe youll be running against former President TrumpTHE PRESIDENT Oh come on I dont even think about I dont I have no idea I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party Do you I know you dont have to answer my question but I mean you know do youI mean look this is the way I view things Ive become a great respecter of fate in my life I set a goal thats in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about which are hardworking decent American people who are getting really having it stuck to themI want to change the paradigm I want to change the paradigm We start to reward work not just wealth I want to change the paradigmIf you notice dont you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had if there is any tax to be had as they talk about it in dealing with the the act that we just passed which puts money in peoples pockets ordinary peopleDid you hear them complain when they passed close to a 2 trillion Trump tax cut 83 percent going to the top 1 percent Did you hear them talk about that all I love the fact that theyve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget Its kind of amazingWhen the federal budget is saving peoples lives they dont think its such a good idea When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes reducing taxes to the point that people who are making you know if youre a husband and wife a schoolteacher and a cop youre paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is something is wrong Their newfound concernIm concerned look I meant what I said when I ran And a lot of you still think Im wrong and I respect that I said Im running for three reasons to restore the soul dignity honor honesty transparency to the American political system two to rebuild the backbone of this country the middle class hardworking people and people struggling to get in the middle class They built America and unions built them The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country And generically speaking all of you said No you cant do that Well Ive not been able to unite the Congress but Ive been uniting the country based on the polling data We have to come together We have toSo from my perspective you know its a to me its about just you know getting out there putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people just hardworking people People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids to be able have a little bit of breathing room being able to have make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling like my dad wondering whether since he didnt have health insurance what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick These are basic things Basic thingsAnd Im of the view that the vast majority of people including registered Republicans by and large share that that same that same view that same sense of what is you know whats appropriateJustin Justin Sink BloombergQ Thanks Mr President I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that youve been in office for a couple months Theres obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical and theres the continued human rights abusesSo today Im wondering Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China Are you considering banning imports of forcedlabor products And would you consider cutting off US investment or Chinese access to international payment systemsTHE PRESIDENT Well look theyre each specifically legitimate questions but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is aboutIve known Xi Jinping for a long time Allegedly by the time I left office as Vice President I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of ChinaSo I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter my interpreter and his going into great detail He is very very straightforward Doesnt have a democratic with a small D bone in his body But hes a smart smart guy Hes one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy cant function in an ever an evercomplex worldSo when I was elected and he called to congratulate me I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people were on call as well as mine listening we had a twohour conversation For two hoursAnd we made several things clear to one another I made it clear to him again what Ive told him in person on several occasions that were not looking for confrontation although we know there will be steep steep competitionTwo that well have strong competition but well insist that China play by the international rules fair competition fair practices fair tradeThirdly in order to compete effectively I indicated that were going to deal with China effectively and were going to need three things to do that I tell him our people First were going to invest in American workers and American science I said that all through the campaign and I say it again And were and Im setting up my administration to be able to do that which is that you know back in the 60s we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science Today its 07 percent Im going to change that Were going to change thatThe future lies in who can in fact own the future as it relates to technology quantum computing a whole range of things including in medical fields And so what Im going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percentOne of the reasons why Ive set up the the PAB PCAST the Presidents board with scientists and the like again is were going to invest in medical research cancer Alzheimers diabetes the things industries of the future artificial intelligence quantum computing biotech And were going to make real investments China is out investing us by a longshot because their plan is to own that futureThe third the second thing were going to do is were going to reestablish our alliances And Ive been very clear with him its not antiChinese And weve talked about itI want to make sure that for example later today after this as a matter of fact shortly after this which is fine weve been going close to an hour Im happy to go longer But one of the things that Im going to be doing Im going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly I think within the next hour or so I dont know the exact timeAnd earlier this month and apparently it got the Chineses attention thats not why I did it I met with our allies and how were going to hold China accountable in the region Australia India Japan and the United States the socalled Quad Because we have to have democracies working togetherBefore too long Im going to have Im going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future And so were going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules to follow the rules whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other thingsAnd the third thing and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands he makes no pretense about not understanding what Im saying any more than I do him I pointed out to him No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country And I said as And Mr President as Ive told you before Americans value the notion of freedom America values human rights We dont always live up to our expectations but its a values system We are founded on that principle And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights were going to continue in an unrelenting way to call to the attention of the world and make it clear make it clear whats happeningAnd he understood that I made it clear that no American President at least one did but no American President ever back down from speaking out of whats happening to the Uighurs whats happening in Hong Kong whats happening incountryThats who we are The moment a President walks away from that as the last one did is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world Its who we areSo I see stiff competition with China China has an overall goal and I dont criticize them for the goal but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world Thats not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expandQ All right Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies Is that where you expect in a multilateral way to make these decisions about sanctions Or THE PRESIDENT No thats not where I make the decision thats where I make sure were all on the same page All on the same page Look I predict to you your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded autocracy or democracy Because that is what is at stake not just with ChinaLook around the world Were in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence Will there be middle class How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment How will they do that And are democracies equipped because all the people get to speak to competeIt is clear absolutely clear and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocraciesIf you notice you dont have Russia talking about communism anymore Its about an autocracy Demand decisions made by a leader of a country thats whats at stake here Weve got to prove democracy worksQ And Mr President sorry I know you havent had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control Wondering if youve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun controlTHE PRESIDENT All the above Its a matter of timingAs youve all observed successful presidents better than me have been successful in large part because they know how to time what theyre doing order it decide and prioritize what needs to be doneThe next major initiative is and Ill be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail is to rebuild the infrastructure both physical and technological infrastructure in this country so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really goodpaying jobs Really goodpaying jobsAnd some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative I still think the majority of the American people dont like the fact that we are now ranked what 85th in the world in infrastructureI mean look the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel ports that you can get in and out of quickly so businesses decideSome of you if you were ever local reporters and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community whats the first thing that businesses asked Whats the closest access to access to an interstate highway How far am I from a freight rail Is the water is the water available Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business All the things that relate to infrastructureWe have somewhere I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did not for this but for a longer discussion We have somewhere in terms of infrastructure we have we rank 13th globally in infrastructure China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States isBridges More than one third of our bridges 231000 of them need repairs Some are physical safety risks or preservation work One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition Thats 186000 miles of highway Aviation 20 percent of all flights 20 percent of all flights werent on time resulting in 15 million hours lost in production Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines We have over 100000 wellheads that are not capped leaking methaneWhat are we doing And by the way we can put as many pipefitters and miners and to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wellsSo I I just find it frustrated frustrating to talk aboutLast point Ill make on the infrastructure and I apologize for spending more time on it but is that if you think about it its the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity at the same time providing really good jobs for people But we cant build back to what they used to be We have to build the environment has global warming has already done significant damageThe roads that used to be above the water level didnt have to worry about where the drainage ditch was now you got to rebuild them three feet higher Because its not going to go back to what it was before it will only get worse unless we stop itTheres so much we can do Look at all of the schools in America Most of you live in the Washington area now But in your hometowns I dont know where youre all from how many schools where the kids cant drink the water out of the fountain How many schools are still in the position where theres asbestos How many schools in America were sending our kids to dont have adequate ventilation How many homes buildings office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they cant hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections Its amazingSo theres so much we can do thats good stuff makes people healthier and creates good jobsAnd I think that I got one more question here Janet from UnivisionQ Thank you Mr President We too have been reporting at the border And just like Cecilia we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday who were detained by CBP had the phone number for their mother who lives in the US We have contacted the mother Thats the only way they know her kids are here because CBP today Thursday has not contacted that mother So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processingTHE PRESIDENT Well theyre already getting better but theyre going to get real theyll get a whole hell of lot better real quick or were going to hear of some people leaving okayWe can get this done Were going to get it doneI had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinetlevel officers the other night Were going to be moving within the next within the next week over 100000 I mean 1000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe secure beds and facilities Were going to significantly ramp up Were already out there contacting everyone from getting some of the employees at HHS and theres a lot of them doing other things and move them into making those calls Were in a were in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that doneBut I admire the fact that you were down there youre making the calls yourself Its realThe next thing that has to happen though as you well know has to happen there have to be some certitude that this is the actually mom dad or whomever And theres ways to do that Theres ways to do that a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card you know What was your dogs name kind of a thing Im being a bit facetious but not really And also seeking harder data from DNA to to birth certificates which takes longer So I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possibleQ As you well know treating the root cau causes in Latin America doesnt change things overnight How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the US when things will not get better in their countries right awayTHE PRESIDENT Well I cant guarantee that But I know you know that old thing The journey of 1000 miles starts with the first stepYou know as well as I do you cover it You have serious its not like somebody at a sitting handhewn table in Guatemala I mean in in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe saying I got a great idea Lets sell everything we have Give it to a coyote Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they dont speak the language Wont that be fun Lets go Thats not how it happens People dont want to leaveWhen my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea expectation was Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America But they left because of what the Brits had been doing They were in real real trouble They didnt want to leave But they had no choice So you got we cant I cant guarantee were going to solve everything but I can guarantee we can make everything better We can make it better We can change the lives of so many peopleAnd the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out I realize its much more heart wrenching and it is to deal with a five and six and sevenyearold But you went down there and you saw The vast majority of these children 70 percent are 16 years old 17 years old and mostly males Doesnt make it that doesnt make it good bad or indifferent But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these Godawful facilities that are really little babies crying all night and theres some thats true Thats why we got to actAnd yesterday I asked my team both the director of the two agencies as well as others I asked them what would they in fact and I asked their opinion because theyre the experts but I said Focus on the most vulnerable immediatelyBut theres no reason why in the next month as people cross the border that phone call cant be made in the first 48 hours and beginQ If I may ask one last question Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolvedTHE PRESIDENT No because I know they have to posture for a while They sort of got to get it out of their system This is a but Im ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation betterBut folks Im going Thank you very very much I appreciate it Thank you
"March 11, 2021: Remarks on the Anniversary of the Coronavirus Shutdown",https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-11-2021-remarks-anniversary-coronavirus-shutdown,Joe Biden,2021-03-11,"On the first anniversary of the shutdown due to Covid-19, President Joe Biden gives his first prime-time televised address to the American people. He remembers all the losses of the past year and the more than 500,000 people who died from Covid. He touts the efforts to vaccinate all Americans throughout the country, pledging ""all adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1."" He also mentions the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that he signed to deliver immediate relief to millions of people.",THE PRESIDENT Good evening my fellow AmericansTonight Id like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemicA year ago we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread uncheckedDenials for days weeks then months that led to more deaths more infections more stress and more lonelinessPhotos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era The last vacation The last birthday with friends The last holiday with the extended familyWhile it was different for everyone we all lost somethingA collective suffering A collective sacrifice A year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of usBut in the loss we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation respect and gratitudeFinding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do In fact it may be the most American thing we doAnd thats what weve doneWeve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives sometimes losing them to save and help others Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine And so many of you as Hemingway wrote being strong in all the broken placesI know its been hard I truly knowAs Ive told you before I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date Its on the back of my schedule As of now the total deaths in America 527726 Thats more deaths than in World War One World War Two the Vietnam War and 911 combinedThey were husbands wives sons and daughters grandparents friends neighbors young and old They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal even to have a funeralBut Im also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes by cruel fate of accident or other diseases They too died alone They too leave loved ones behind who are hurting badlyYou know youve often heard me say before I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his childs bedroom to say Im sorry I lost my job We cant be here anymore Like my Dad told me when he lost his job in ScrantonSo many of you have had to make that same walk this past yearYou lost your job You closed your business Facing eviction homelessness hunger a loss of control and maybe worst of all a loss of hopeWatching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more because theyve not been in school because of their loss of learningIts the details of life that matter most and weve missed those detailsThe big details and small momentsWeddings birthdays graduations all the things that needed to happen but didnt The first date The family reunions The Sunday night ritualsIts all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others to talk to laugh to hug to hold one anotherBut this virus has kept us apartGrandparents havent seen their children or grandchildren Parents havent seen their kids Kids havent seen their friendsThe things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldnt do and broke our heartsToo often weve turned against one anotherA mask the easiest thing to do to save lives sometimes it divides usStates pitted against one other instead of working with each otherVicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who have been attacked harassed blamed and scapegoated At this very moment so many of them our fellow Americans theyre on the frontlines of this pandemic trying to save lives and still still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America Its wrong its unAmerican and it must stopLook we know what we need to do to beat this virus Tell the truth Follow the scientists and the science Work together Put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function which is protecting the American people no function more importantWe need to remember the government isnt some foreign force in a distant capital No its us All of us We the People For you and I that America thrives when we give our hearts when we turn our hands to common purpose And right now my friends we are doing just that And I have to say as your President I am grateful to youLast summer I was in Philadelphia and I met a smallbusiness owner a woman I asked her I said What do you need most Ill never forget what she said to me She said looking me in the eye she said I just want the truth The truth Just tell me the truth Think of thatMy fellow Americans youre owed nothing less than the truthAnd for all of you asking when things will get back to normal here is the truth The only way to get our lives back to get our economy back on track is to beat the virusYouve been hearing me say that for while I was running and the last 50 days Ive been President But this is one of the most complex operations weve under ever undertaken as a nation in a long timeThats why Im using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done It sounds like hyperbole but I mean it a war footingAnd thank God were making some real progress nowOn my first full day in office I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic And we have spent every day since attempting to carry it outTwo months ago the country this country didnt have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public But soon we willWeve been working with the vaccine manufacturers Pfizer Moderna Johnson Johnson to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe effective vaccines And now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration Johnson Johnson is working together with a competitor Merck to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson Johnson vaccine which is one shotIn fact just yesterday I announced and I met with the CEOs of both companies I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson Johnson vaccines These two companies competitors have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for itIts truly a national effort just like we saw during World War IINow because of all the work weve done well have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May Thats months ahead of scheduleAnd were mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in ones arm Calling on active duty military FEMA retired doctors and nurses administrators and those to administer the shotsAnd weve been creating more places to get the shots Weve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one any one of nearly 10000 pharmacies across the country just like you get your flu shotWere also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot get your shot never leave your car and drive home in less than an hourWeve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America located in underserved areas And weve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and popup clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get itWe continue to work on making athome testing availableAnd weve been focused on serving people in the hardesthit communities of this pandemic Black Latino Native American and rural communitiesSo what does all this add up to When I took office 50 days ago only 8 percent of Americans after months only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination Today that number is nearly 65 percent Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75 50 days ago had gotten their first shot Today that number is well over 70 percentWith new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the CDC that came out on Monday it means simply this Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so And the more people who are fully vaccinated the CD CDC will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace places of worship with friends and as well as travelWhen I came into office you may recall I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top I said I intended to get 100 million shots in peoples arms in my first 100 days in office Tonight I can say we are not only going to meet that goal were going to beat that goal Because were actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office No other country in the world has done this NoneNow I want to talk about the next steps were thinking aboutFirst tonight Im announcing that I will direct all states tribes and territories to make all adults people 18 and over eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1Let me say that again All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1 Thats much earlier than expectedLet me be clear That doesnt mean everyones going to have that shot immediately but it means youll be able to get in line beginning May 1 Every adult will be eligible to get their shotTo do this were going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December before I was sworn in to maintaining beating our current pace of two million shots a day outpacing the rest of the worldSecondly at the time when every adult is eligible in May we will launch with our partners new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved onesThirdly with the passage of the American Rescue Plan and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff including bus drivers we can accelerate the massive nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal that I stated at the same time about 100 million shots of opening the majority of K8 schools in my first 100 days in office This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education Miguel CardonaFourth in the coming weeks we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated to lessen the confusion to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinatedAnd finally fifth and maybe most importantly I promise I will do everything in my power I will not relent until we beat this virus but I need you the American people I need you I need every American to do their part And thats not hyperbole I need youI need you to get vaccinated when its your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as wellBecause heres the point If we do all this if we do our part if we do this together by July the 4th theres a good chance you your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day That doesnt mean large events with lots of people together but it does mean small groups will be able to get togetherAfter this long hard year that will make this Independence Day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virusBut to get there we cant let our guard downThis fight is far from order from over As I told the woman in Pennsylvania I will tell you the truthA July 4th with your loved ones is the goal But a goal a lot can happen conditions can changeThe scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spreadAnd weve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccinesSo my message to you is this Listen to Dr Fauci one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world He has assured us the vaccines are safe They underwent rigorous scientific review I know theyre safe Vice President Harris and I know theyre safe Thats why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so for the world to see so you could see us do it The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinatedTalk to your family your friends your neighbors the people you know best whove gotten the vaccineWe need everyone to get vaccinated We need everyone to keep washing their hands stay socially distanced and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDCBecause even if we devote every resource we have beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unityAnd national unity isnt just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans Because if we dont stay vigilant and the conditions change then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track And please we dont want to do againWeve made so much progress This is not the time to let up Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rulesIll close with thisWeve lost so much over the last yearWeve lost family and friendsWeve lost businesses and dreams we spent years buildingWeve lost time time with each otherAnd our children have lost so much time with their friends time with their schools No graduation ceremonies this this spring No graduations from college high school movingup ceremoniesYou know and theres something else we lostWe lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American peopleBut as I stand here tonight were proving once again something I have said time and time again until theyre probably tired of hearing me say it I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike Its never ever a good bet to bet against the American people America is coming backThe development manufacture and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplishedAnd we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity commitment and belief in science and one anotherAnd today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people It includes 1400 in direct rescue checks payments That means a typical family of four earning about 110000 will get checks for 5600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check a Treasury checkIt extends unemployment benefits It helps small businesses It lowers healthcare premiums for many It provides food and nutrition keeps families in their homes And it will cut child poverty in this country in half according to the experts And it fi and it funds all the steps Ive just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobsIn the coming weeks and months Ill be traveling along with the First Lady the Vice President the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet to speak directly to you to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment And if it fails at any pa I will acknowledge that it failed But it will notAbout how after a long dark years one whole year there is hope and light of better days aheadIf we all do our part this country will be vaccinated soon our economy will be on the mend our kids will be back in school and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything hard things big things important thingsOver a year ago no one couldve imagined what we were about to go through but now were coming through it and its a shared experience that binds us together as a nation We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by But were also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of usMy fervent prayer for our country is that after all we have been through well come together as one people one nation one AmericaI believe we can and we will Were seizing this moment And history I believe will record We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nations history darkest weve ever knownI promise you well come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves a renewed commitment to one another to our communities and to our countryThis is the United States of America and there is nothing nothing from the bottom of my heart I believe this there is nothing we cant do when we do it togetherSo God bless you allAnd please God give solace to all those people who lost someoneAnd may God protect our troopsThank you for taking the time to listenI look forward to seeing you

sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailedIn each of these moments enough of us came together to carry all of us forwardAnd we can do so nowHistory faith and reason show the way the way of unityWe can see each other not as adversaries but as neighborsWe can treat each other with dignity and respectWe can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperatureFor without unity there is no peace only bitterness and furyNo progress only exhausting outrageNo nation only a state of chaosThis is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forwardAnd we must meet this moment as the United States of AmericaIf we do that I guarantee you we will not failWe have never ever ever failed in America when we have acted togetherAnd so today at this time and in this place let us start afreshAll of usLet us listen to one anotherHear one anotherSee one anotherShow respect to one anotherPolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its pathEvery disagreement doesnt have to be a cause for total warAnd we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufacturedMy fellow Americans we have to be different than thisAmerica has to be better than thisAnd I believe America is better than thisJust look aroundHere we stand in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War when the Union itself hung in the balanceYet we endured and we prevailedHere we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr King spoke of his dreamHere we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to voteToday we mark the swearingin of the first woman in American history elected to national office Vice President Kamala HarrisDont tell me things cant changeHere we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peaceAnd here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy and to drive us from this sacred groundThat did not happenIt will never happenNot todayNot tomorrowNot everTo all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in usTo all those who did not support us let me say this Hear me out as we move forward Take a measure of me and my heartAnd if you still disagree so be itThats democracy Thats America The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our Republic is perhaps our nations greatest strengthYet hear me clearly Disagreement must not lead to disunionAnd I pledge this to you I will be a President for all AmericansI will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who didMany centuries ago Saint Augustine a saint of my church wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their loveWhat are the common objects we love that define us as AmericansI think I knowOpportunitySecurityLibertyDignityRespectHonorAnd yes the truthRecent weeks and months have taught us a painful lessonThere is truth and there are liesLies told for power and for profitAnd each of us has a duty and responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and to defeat the liesI understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidationI understand they worry about their jobs about taking care of their families about what comes nextI get itBut the answer is not to turn inward to retreat into competing factions distrusting those who dont look like you do or worship the way you do or dont get their news from the same sources you doWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus urban conservative versus liberalWe can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our heartsIf we show a little tolerance and humilityIf were willing to stand in the other persons shoes just for a momentBecause here is the thing about life There is no accounting for what fate will deal youThere are some days when we need a handThere are other days when were called on to lend oneThat is how we must be with one anotherAnd if we are this way our country will be stronger more prosperous more ready for the futureMy fellow Americans in the work ahead of us we will need each otherWe will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winterWe are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virusWe must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nationI promise you this as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morningWe will get through this togetherThe world is watching todaySo here is my message to those beyond our borders America has been tested and we have come out stronger for itWe will repair our alliances and engage with the world once againNot to meet yesterdays challenges but todays and tomorrowsWe will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our exampleWe will be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and securityWe have been through so much in this nationAnd in my first act as President I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemicTo those 400000 fellow Americans mothers and fathers husbands and wives sons and daughters friends neighbors and coworkersWe will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should beLet us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives for those they left behind and for our countryAmenThis is a time of testingWe face an attack on democracy and on truthA raging virusGrowing inequityThe sting of systemic racismA climate in crisisAmericas role in the worldAny one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound waysBut the fact is we face them all at once presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilitiesNow we must step upAll of usIt is a time for boldness for there is so much to doAnd this is certainWe will be judged you and I for how we resolve the cascading crises of our eraWill we rise to the occasionWill we master this rare and difficult hourWill we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our childrenI believe we must and I believe we willAnd when we do we will write the next chapter in the American storyIts a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to meIts called American Anthem and there is one verse stands out for meThe work and prayersof centuries have brought us to this dayWhat shall be our legacyWhat will our children sayLet me know in my heartWhen my days are throughAmericaAmericaI gave my best to youLet us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nationIf we do this then when our days are through our children and our childrens children will say of us they gave their bestThey did their dutyThey healed a broken landMy fellow Americans I close today where I began with a sacred oathBefore God and all of you I give you my wordI will always level with youI will defend the ConstitutionI will defend our democracyI will defend AmericaI will give my all in your service thinking not of power but of possibilitiesNot of personal interest but of the public goodAnd together we shall write an American story of hope not fearOf unity not divisionOf light not darknessAn American story of decency and dignityOf love and of healingOf greatness and of goodnessMay this be the story that guides usThe story that inspires usThe story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of historyWe met the momentThat democracy and hope truth and justice did not die on our watch but thrivedThat our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the worldThat is what we owe our forebearers one another and generations to followSo with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our timeSustained by faithDriven by convictionAnd devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our heartsMay God bless America and may God protect our troopsThank you America
